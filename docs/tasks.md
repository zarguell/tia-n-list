### Milestone 6: Enterprise-Grade CTI Enhancement - Simplified

Based on feedback assessment of October 29, 2025 briefing output. Elevate from "very good" to "enterprise-grade professional CTI product" using prompt engineering approach.

**Priority 1: Enhanced LLM Synthesis (High Impact)**
- [x] [auto] **Prompt Configuration Architecture**: Separate prompts from code for better configuration management
  - [x] [auto] Create `config/prompts/` directory with structured prompt templates
  - [x] [auto] Implement prompt loader module (`src/prompt_loader.py`) for dynamic prompt loading
  - [x] [auto] Design prompt template system with variable substitution (confidence, ATT&CK, industry impact)
  - [x] [auto] Add prompt versioning and A/B testing capabilities
- [x] [auto] **Enhanced Prompt Engineering**: Integrate confidence assessments, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and industry impact analysis into configurable prompts
  - [x] [auto] Add confidence level guidance (Low/Medium/High) to synthesis prompts with industry-standard language
  - [x] [auto] Include MITRE ATT&CK technique identification instructions in analysis prompts
  - [x] [auto] Enhance prompts to emphasize industry-specific impact and exposure analysis
  - [x] [auto] Update blog generation to use external prompt configuration system
- [x] [auto] **Intelligence Gap Identification**: Enhance prompts to explicitly state missing or uncertain information
  - [x] [auto] Add gap analysis requirements to LLM synthesis prompts
  - [x] [auto] Include uncertainty language and confidence qualifiers in prompt instructions
  - [x] [auto] Update blog template to include intelligence gaps section
- [x] [auto] **Professional Tone Enhancement**: Remove joke API calls and refine executive voice
  - [x] [auto] Remove joke API integration from persona module (`src/persona.py`)
  - [x] [auto] Optimize LLM prompts for C-level executive audience
  - [x] [auto] Update blog generation to remove joke section entirely

**Priority 2: Professional CTI Standards (Medium Impact)**
- [ ] [auto] **TLP Markings Implementation**: Add visible Traffic Light Protocol banners and AI disclaimers
  - [ ] [auto] Add TLP: White to Hugo frontmatter for all blog posts
  - [ ] [auto] Design and implement visible TLP banner in Hugo template (top of article)
  - [ ] [auto] Create AI-generated disclaimer section for blog posts
  - [ ] [auto] Integrate TLP and disclaimer into Hugo theme styling
  - [ ] [auto] Update blog generation to include TLP and disclaimer content
- [ ] [auto] **Enhanced IOC Appendix**: Improve structured IOC presentation for machine readability
  - [ ] [auto] Create IOC formatter (`src/ioc_formatter.py`) for clean IOC organization
  - [ ] [auto] Enhance IOC section formatting with proper categorization
  - [ ] [auto] Add IOC validation and deduplication within blog posts

**Priority 3: Content Quality Improvements (Low Impact)**
- [ ] [auto] **Title Accuracy Enhancement**: Improve title generation for better content reflection
  - [ ] [auto] Update title generator prompts to avoid misleading vendor focus
  - [ ] [auto] Add title validation logic against article content themes
  - [ ] [auto] Create neutral title templates for balanced threat intelligence reporting

**Expected Outcomes for Simplified Enhancement:**
- ✅ **Enterprise-Grade Quality**: Professional CTI briefings enhanced through configurable prompt engineering
- ✅ **Standardized Classification**: Confidence assessments and MITRE ATT&CK references via LLM synthesis
- ✅ **Professional Presentation**: Visible TLP banners, AI disclaimers, and improved executive tone with joke removal
- ✅ **Better Configuration Management**: Prompts separated from code for easier tuning and A/B testing
- ✅ **Faster Implementation**: Weeks rather than months through simplified, prompt-based approach
