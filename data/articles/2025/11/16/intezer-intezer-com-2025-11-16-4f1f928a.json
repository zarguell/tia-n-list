    "raw": "tl;dr Greater productivity ≠ greater security outcomes. Kinda like why being able to accelerate from 0-60 MPH doesn&#8217;t help when the ice is cracking under your wheels. And now, the full version. AI SOC shouldn’t just “augment workflows”, that’s a productivity-locked perspective. The goal and the delivery capability that exists right now is to deliver full-scale enterprise triage of 100% of alerts with forensicly-accurate verdicts. That looks like streamlined triage, explainable verdicts, measurable accuracy, and operational resilience. There’s already an AI SOC platform that has operationalized what Gartner calls “emerging”. While recent Gartner reports on “AI SOC Agents” and “SecOps Workflow Augmentation” succeed in elevating the conversation, they also reveal how incomplete that conversation still is. Both documents frame AI in the SOC as a promising but premature experiment, a toolset meant to make analysts more productive, not organizations more secure. That framing misses the point. AI isn’t about automation for automation’s sake; it’s about turning expert knowledge, data, context, and expertise into repeatable, scalable decision-making that covers every alert with confidence and context. The bias in today’s AI SOC conversation Gartner’s reports argue that AI SOC agents should be treated as “workflow augmentation tools” to reduce analyst fatigue and improve response efficiency. They recommend cautious adoption, structured pilots, and human-in-the-loop validation. Pragmatic? When LLMs are relied upon solely, sure. But the underlying assumption that enterprise-proven AI is not yet mature enough to deliver reliable outcomes is outdated. In practice, this mindset anchors the market in productivity metrics, not security performance. It evaluates how efficiently teams work, not how effectively they defend. The focus stays on “mean time to detect” and “mean time to respond,” rather than the more critical questions: Are ALL alerts being triaged? Are verdicts, not just investigations, consistently accurate? Are we actually reducing risk, not just improving the process? Are alerts triaged in seconds &amp; minutes for true containment &amp; response? That’s where the emerging class of true AI SOC platforms breaks away from the Gartner lens. Workflow augmentation isn’t security The distinction matters. Augmentation is an operational improvement; outcomes are a security transformation. Most vendors today build tools that accelerate investigation but still depend on human oversight for every meaningful decision. Those are SOAR 2.0 platforms: automation-centric, workflow-obsessed, and still fundamentally enrichment, not triage. A true AI SOC, by contrast, triages every alert across the stack autonomously, determines a verdict with auditable reasoning, and escalates only when necessary, typically less than four percent of the time. This isn’t a co-pilot; it’s a teammate that already performs at the level of a seasoned analyst and identifies the needles without the haystack. This is incredible for the SOC analysts that are focused on looking at real alerts. Security outcome execution is the critical requirement any true AI SOC should provide: Resolve millions of alerts monthly across distributed environments with &lt;4% escalation rates. Deliver verdict accuracy above 97.7% through hybrid deterministic and AI reasoning. Provide explainable decisions, validated by periodic human review and forensic evidence. Uncover real threats in seconds &amp; minutes, not hours. This isn’t augmentation; it’s execution. The “emerging” technology that’s already operational Gartner describes AI SOC agents as an “emerging technology” that promises to evolve beyond playbook-driven automation. The irony is that enterprise SOCs are already running on these systems today. Fortune 10 environments and thousands of organizations worldwide are triaging every single alert, not just the critical and high-severity ones, through AI that emulates human reasoning at scale. These systems don’t “pilot” AI; they operationalize it. They deliver 24/7 SOC capability, instant triage, and consistent decision-making grounded in explainable logic, not black-box inference. They prove that an AI SOC is no longer a future-state concept. It’s production-grade infrastructure that’s rewriting what operational maturity means, and has been for years now. The difference between Gartner’s caution and what’s happening in practice is simple: proof. Measuring what actually matters The reports fixate on efficiency → MTTD, MTTR, analyst satisfaction, but those metrics only tell half the story especially for antiquated SOCs. The next generation of AI SOCs defines success through security outcome metrics, including: Total alert coverage – Every alert analyzed, across all severities and sources. Verdict accuracy – The supermajority of decisions must be right, consistently and explainably. Escalation rate – Only the rarest cases should reach human review. Explainability – Every verdict is clearly backed by evidence: memory scans, forensic traces, and contextual reasoning. Feedback velocity – Every corrected verdict feeds back into the detection logic, closing the learning loop. When you measure what truly matters, accuracy, coverage, trust, the difference between AI that “helps” and AI that defends becomes obvious. Why “AI SOC Agent” ≠ “AI SOC Platform” The reports conflate two very different things. An “AI SOC agent” is a single use case, an assistant. An “AI SOC platform” is a full operating model: triage, investigation, and response fused into a continuous feedback loop back to detection engineering. One optimizes efficiency; the other drives security transformation. That’s the real inflection point the industry is standing at. SOCs that treat AI as a productivity booster will get marginal gains, which is a great thing for the industry. SOCs that rebuild around AI as a core operating principle will experience exponential gains with real risk reduction. In other words: this isn’t about speeding up analysts, it’s about scaling their expertise across the entire alert surface. From AI promise to proof The challenge now isn’t technology, it’s perception. The AI SOC has already proven it can outperform legacy models built on manual triage and brittle playbooks. It has shown that full alert coverage, explainable verdicts, and continuous learning can coexist with human oversight and compliance. The industry doesn’t need another year of pilots to “validate the promise.” It needs a new standard of performance. The next evolution of the SOC will be measured not by how well it augments workflows, but by how confidently it can: Detect and triage every signal. Deliver verdicts with explainable evidence. Quantify accuracy in measurable, repeatable terms. Strengthen analyst trust through transparency. That’s the AI SOC outcome model, here today. Final thoughts Gartner’s perspective is valuable for shaping the taxonomy of an emerging market. But the reality on the ground has already overtaken the research. The world doesn’t need another whitepaper on “potential.” It needs proof of performance, and it exists. The future SOC isn’t augmented. It’s autonomous, accurate, and accountable for strategic security outcomes that CISOs and leaders require, either now or in the next few months with the executive leadership push to operationalize AI. The world’s largest enterprises today already benefit from the real market-defining traits of a forensic AI SOC. To learn more about Intezer’s Forensic AI SOC platform, schedule a demo today!
