It's a tool that turns a hard, tedious job into a much quicker, easier task. It's one of those tools that I now can't do without. That means I'm always on the lookout for cordless screwdrivers that are good quality, robust, and affordable.\nAlso: My favorite cordless screwdriver of all time can handle any task for me\nA company that has been hitting it out of the park lately when it comes to high-quality tools is Hoto, and the latest PixelDrive cordless electric screwdriver is another winner.\nSo what separates the PixelDrive from the crowd?\nAlso: Can you trust a $15 cordless screwdriver from Amazon? I tested one and have no regrets\nFirst, as the name suggests, it features a cool, curved, and clear smart display that never leaves you guessing about the torque setting or battery life. It's the first of its kind I've seen on a tool like this, and it's a neat idea. This is a game-changer, and it made me realize just how unintuitive it is to squint at a small dial or blinking LEDs to figure out what setting your tool is in.\nChanging torque settings is also a snap -- you literally twist the dial on the front, allowing you to shift from off through six settings -- 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6Nm -- meaning the screwdriver is just as capable of handling heavy-duty tasks like furniture building as it is putting a PC together.\nAlso: 10 DIY gadgets I never leave out of my toolkit (and why each one earns its spot)\nThe screwdriver can also handle 8Nm manual torque, which is perfect for breaking free those tough fasteners. The ergonomic design of the screwdriver's body makes it comfortable to deliver that kind of torque by hand.\nOn the front is an LED ring that perfectly and shadowlessly illuminates the work area. It's bright enough to let you see what's happening without being blinding.\nAlso: This electric screwdriver is a reliable addition to my toolkit - and it just got even cheaper\nAlong with the smart display is a smart two-stage forward/back trigger for activating the screwdriver. Lightly press the trigger for 80 RPM low-speed mode, and fully depress for the full 200 RPM. It's a nice, easy, and smooth trigger that I got used to quickly, and the ability to shift from one speed to the other makes this a really easy screwdriver to control.\nThe PixelDrive is powered by a 2,000mAh Li-ion battery that lasts for ages. When it needs recharging, all I need to do is plug a USB-C cable into the base of the screwdriver, and it will go from flat to full in under three hours.\nAlso: I spent $30 on a high-quality multitool, and it's already paying off for me\nThe PixelDrive comes with a cool three-piece holder and 30 high-quality, hard-wearing bits in a range of sizes.\nZDNET's buying advice\nWhen I review something, I try not to look at the price because I like to figure out how much something is worth to me. I would happily pay $100 for the Hoto PixelDrive, so imagine my surprise when I found out it has a list price of $80 and that there's currently 25% off on Amazon, bringing the price down to $60.\nAlso: 10 pocket-sized tools that make life easier - and how I use each\nThis is one of those \"as good as they get\" tools. It's well-designed, powerful, ergonomic, and built to last. And it's now at a price that makes it unmissable for the tool enthusiast.\nLooking for the next best product?
