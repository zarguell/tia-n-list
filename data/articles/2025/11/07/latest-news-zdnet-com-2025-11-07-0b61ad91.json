We gather data from the best available sources, including vendor and retailer listings as well as other relevant and independent reviews sites.

Around Black Friday, which is just a few weeks away, we typically see some of the lowest prices of the year on popular streaming services.\nAlso: The best Black Friday deals live now\nWhile these streaming Black Friday deals are some of the best we've seen all year, make sure you read the fine print: Some are only open to new or returning subscribers, and others are for ad-supported plans, not ad-free ones. Still, they're all worth checking out.\nAlso worth considering: When you subscribe to Walmart+, you get your choice of Paramount+ or Peacock included, and when you subscribe to Amazon Prime, you get Prime Video and Amazon Music (don't forget that if you're age 18-24, you can get a 6-month free trial and then pay half the regular price for a Prime for Young Adults membership).\nI've been reviewing streaming services for ZDNET and our sister site CNET for years, and these are my picks for the best Black Friday streaming deals so far.\nBest early Black Friday streaming deals\n- Current price: $73/month for the first three months\n- Original price: $83/month\nYouTube TV is our pick for the best live TV streaming service, so if you've been thinking about cutting the cord, this deal could be a great option for you. YouTube TV includes unlimited DVR, and more than 100 channels, including AMC, Bravo, CBS, FX, NBA TV, Disney Channel, and Nickelodeon. You can also add on NFL Sunday Ticket for an additional cost.\n- Current price: $30/year\n- Original price: $70/year\nSave 39% per month for your first year of Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN with this limited-time bundle deal. With the deal, new and eligible returning subscribers will pay $30/month for the ad-supported versions of the three streaming services, or $39/month for the ad-free versions, both for the first 12 months of service.\n- Current price: $30/year\n- Original price: $70/year\nRight now when you pay $30 up front, you can access Starz for an entire year, which comes out to just $2.50/month. The offer is available to both new and previous Starz subscribers who want to re-subscribe via Starz.com. If you're interested in anything in the Starz library -- which includes shows like Outlander and The Couple Next Door, and tons of movies -- this is a great deal.\nThe service is ad-free, and you can download content, or stream on multiple devices simultaneously.\nStarz is also offering a deal to pay $5/month for the first three months of service, after which the price would return to $11/month.\n- Current price: $15/month\n- Original price: $24/month\nRight now, you can bundle an Apple TV subscription with a Peacock Premium subscription for $15 per month -- that's just $2 more per month than the cost of Apple TV alone. Or, pay $20 per month for Apple TV bundled with Peacock Premium Plus, Peacock's no ads plan that also allows for downloads.\n- Current price: $29 (28% off)\n- Original price: $40\nZDNET editor Maria Diaz has tested every Roku streaming stick, and recommends the Roku Streaming Stick Plus \"to anyone looking for a 4K streaming device, whether your TV is smart or not. These devices will give your TV a smart, intuitive platform and access to hundreds of free channels and media files via the Roku Channel.\"\n- Current price: $30 (40% off)\n- Original price: $50\nThe Alexa-enabled Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K includes an AI-powered search feature that lets you find movies by actor, plot, and even quote. It also lets you access free movies and TV shows from ad-supported streaming apps like Fire TV Channels, Prime Video, Tubi, and Pluto TV.\nAlso: Roku vs. Fire Stick: Which one is best for your streaming needs?\nFAQs\nWhen is Black Friday?\nThis year, Black Friday is Friday, Nov. 28, 2025 -- the day after Thanksgiving. Cyber Monday is Monday, Dec. 1, 2025.\nAre streaming services really cheaper during Black Friday?\nOften, yes. In recent years, we've seen the lowest prices of the year for subscriptions to Hulu, Paramount+, and more during Black Friday week. We've also seen some of the lowest prices of the year on streaming accessories, like\nHow did we choose these early Black Friday deals?\nZDNET only writes about deals we want to buy -- services, devices, and products we desire, need, or would recommend. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.\nWe also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.",
