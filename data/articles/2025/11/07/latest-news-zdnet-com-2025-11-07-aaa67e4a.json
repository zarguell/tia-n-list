It's the time of the year when you can score huge discounts on smartphones, laptops, and especially video games. Retailers such as Walmart, Target, and Best Buy are already offering early discounts on consoles, popular titles, and accessories. And few brands bring the deals quite like Nintendo.\nAlso: Best early Black Friday PlayStation deals 2025\n2025 has been a big year for Nintendo as the gaming giant launched a brand new console: the Switch 2. While the latest model has stolen the spotlight, the original Switch remains a great handheld device that continues to receive new releases and support. Whether you're shopping for your first console or planning to upgrade, I've rounded up the best early Black Friday Switch deals so you can get your holiday shopping done before the rush.\nBest early Black Friday Nintendo Switch deals\n- Current price: $700 (13% off)\n- Original price: $800\nThe Switch 2 is a significant upgrade over the previous model, sporting better hardware, a larger, more vibrant touchscreen, and a revamped pair of controllers with optical sensors that allow them to function as computer mice. This bundle is the best I've seen. It packages Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and a Joy-Con 2 Wheel.\n- Current price: $320 (9% off)\n- Original price: $350\nThe Nintendo Switch has been a massive success for the company, and for good reason. It is a versatile gaming device that supports three different playstyles, has an enormous game library, and has a long-lasting battery. I recommend that you buy the OLED model for its superior visual output. Colors are much more vibrant, and black hues are darker on this version of the Switch than on the original, which has an LCD screen.\n- Current price: $450 (10% off)\n- Original price: $500\nThis Nintendo Switch provides a lot of value for its price. In addition to the console, this bundle comes with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe preloaded on the device, a copy of Super Mario RPG, a free 12-month subscription to Nintendo Switch Online, a screen protector, a protective case, and more.\n- Current price: $70 (13% off)\n- Original price: $80\nThe Switch's Joy-Cons are praised for their versatility, comfortable design, and robust features like motion controls. It's not an exaggeration to say that the Joy-Cons are some of my favorite gaming controllers of all time. I have a pair and plan on continuing to use them until they fall apart. Over at Target, you can get a pair of refurbished controllers from Nintendo for 13% off.\n- Current price: $19.50 (35% off)\n- Original price: $30\nThe Switch's Charging Grip does multiple jobs at once. You can attach your Joy-Con to the grip and use them together as a more traditional controller for more comfortable gameplay. It can also be used to recharge the Joy-Cons while you play. There's a USB-C port around the back of the grip that feeds directly into the battery.\n- Current price: $60 (13% off)\n- Original price: $69\nSuper Mario Galaxy is one of my favorite games of all time. The title sees Mario embark on a space-faring adventure to save the universe from the clutches of Bowser. This bundle includes Super Mario Galaxy 2, which introduces Yoshi to the team for even more fun and excitement. What's great about the Switch version is its playable on the Switch 2 and harness the better hardware on the newer consoles for better graphical fidelity.\n- Current price: $50.50 (15% off)\n- Original price: $60\nMetroid Dread is a momentous entry in the long-running series as it is the first 2D title in nearly 20 years.

Upon landing, she becomes trapped and must fight her way out while being hunted by an unknown enemy.\n- Current price: $26 (47% off)\n- Original price: $49\nRelive the glory days of arcades with this Marvel vs. Capcom collection. It packs six games on one cartridge, including the legendary Marvel vs. Capcom 2, X-Men: Children of the Atom, and Marvel Super Heroes. These classic titles have been revamped for high-definition visuals and come with modern features, including a training mode. Online play is supported, so you can play with people around the world.\n- Current price: $30 (49% off)\n- Original price: $59\nBecome vengeance; become the night. Batman Arkham Trilogy consists of three action-packed games where you play as Batman as he takes on the worst of Gotham City. The first game, Arkham Asylum, will task you with freeing the asylum from the clutches of the Joker. Arkham City, the second game, sees Batman trapped in a new maximum-security facility made up of parts of Gotham. Arkham Knight is the thrilling conclusion that pits Batman against his greatest challenge.\n- Current price: $120 (40% off)\n- Original price: $200\nBlock out the world and immerse yourself fully in the game. The HyperX Cloud Alpha is a wireless headset that features a pair of Dual Chamber Drivers, which fine-tune the mid- and high-range frequencies separately from the bass to deliver exceptionally clear audio. It also supports DTS Spatial Audio to deliver \"precise sound localization\". Its durable aluminum frame makes sure the Cloud Alpha headphones will last for years. And as the cherry on top, the pair boasts a battery life of up to 300 hours.\nMore early Black Friday Nintendo Switch deals\n- Nintendo Switch Gray: $295 (save $66): Enjoy versatile gaming on the go.

It's one of the best times of the year to score deep discounts on Nintendo Switch consoles, games, and accessories from major retailers like Best Buy, Walmart, and Amazon. Many of these sales are expected to carry over until Cyber Monday, December 1.\nIs the Nintendo Switch really cheaper during Black Friday?\nAbsolutely. The Nintendo Switch is almost always cheaper on Black Friday and Cyber Week. Retailers also slash prices on popular console packages, accessories, and games, with saving that can easily reach $100 or more. This sales event is usually the price time to get a Switch or Switch 2. Nintendo rarely lowers the prices on its devices and games, so it can be tough to find discounts outside of special events or promotions.\nHow did we choose these early Black Friday deals?\nAt ZDNET, we only highlight Nintendo Switch deals worth your money -- the same kind we'd consider ourselves. For this roundup, I specifically sought out Switch models, games, and accessories that were about 15% off or more. Black Friday is still several weeks away, so significant discounts are not yet available. Knowing this, I expanded my search to include lesser discounts to fill out the list. Although some price drops aren't as deep as others, they're still worth consideration because they offer unique value in other areas.\nI considered hands-on experience, real-world performance, and customer feedback. Every recommendation on this list is backed by careful research and expert insight so that you can confidently shop these early Black Friday sales.",
