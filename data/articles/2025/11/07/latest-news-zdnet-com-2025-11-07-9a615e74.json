But if you're looking to get a jump on your holiday shopping, retailers like Amazon and Best Buy are already offering markdowns on everything you need to upgrade your PC gaming setup. From monitors and headsets, keyboards and speakers, to desktops and laptops, you'll be able to build the battle station you've always dreamed of without spending a fortune.\nAre gaming PCs and accessories really cheaper during Black Friday?\nWhile you're more likely to see the steepest discounts on accessories like headsets, keyboards, and mice, as well as sales on digital games, you can still snap up a new desktop or laptop for a decent price if you keep a sharp eye out. You can also find decent discounts on PC building components, like CPUs and SSDs for upgrading your current build or setting up a new DIY PC.\nHow did we choose these early Black Friday deals?\nThe holiday shopping season is prime sale time for all things gaming, and with so much going on sale at once, it can be hard to know where to look to find the best markdowns on things you actually want or need for your setup. I only included computers, peripherals, and accessories from well-known and trusted brands like HP and Lenovo, because taking a gamble on an unknown brand usually ends in disaster on Christmas morning. I also only included the best discounts I could find on the most sought-after components and accessories, as well as pre-built desktops and gaming laptops, and I didn't include anything that wasn't at least 15% off to help you get the most out of your holiday shopping budget.",
