It brings the base model wearable closer to the Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 than ever before, all for the same price as the previous Watch SE 2 when it was released three years ago: $249. Plus, it's on sale for $200 at Amazon.\nAlso: I compared every Apple Watch in 2025 - here's why I recommend this model the most\nWearable expert Nina Raemont says its the best watch for budget shoppers and first-time buyers, and it's the one she recommends the most. This year, the Watch SE 3 got a ton of new features, like fast charging, Sleep Score, Sleep Apnea detection, and temperature sensing -- a massive upgrade from the Watch SE 2. This watch is future-proofed for the next few years, and is a competitive option on the market. It's a great gift for children and teenagers, elderly individuals, and no-fuss, Apple smartwatch users.\nThese smart glasses have been a hot product at ZDNET this year, and our expert loves them for their wide-screen effect, seamless combination of productivity and entertainment, and comfort.\nAlso: These XR glasses gave me a 200-inch screen to work with - and effectively replaced my monitors\nThanks to the X1 chip, no special software is required for the advanced functionality of these glasses, the FOV is the best available, the glasses are comfortable, and the display is bright and clear. These are pricey, but also functional.\nThough these earbuds are admittedly pricey (but good sleep is priceless), they reduced in price to $299 this year. Ozlo's sleep earbuds are made by ex-Bose engineers, and they use a lot of the same technology as Bose's retired sleep earbuds.\nAlso: No silent night in sight? These sleep earbuds help me fall asleep in my noisy bedroom\nIn fact, they're ZDNET's pick for the best overall sleep earbuds after being rigorously evaluated by our earbud expert Nina Raemont. Raemont said they beat out other sleep earbud options from brands like Anker and that they blocked out noise more than anticipated.\n\"These earbuds dissolved in my ears during sleep, and, as I shuffled from one side to the other, I found myself absolutely unirritated with these buds in my ears. The Ozlo Sleepbuds masked noises properly and efficiently, dulling down the outside hubbub on one of the busiest weeks of the year in my neighborhood,\" she says.\nNintendo's latest Switch 2 model is sure to be a popular holiday gift this year, and for good reason. Our reviews managing editor got his hands on the new model back in June and says the Switch 2 is a \"major upgrade\" from its predecessor.\nAlso: I managed to buy a Nintendo Switch 2 - and it's easy to see why it's flying off shelves\nWan says that the changes are well received. \"All of these changes equate to a gaming experience that, after just a few days of playtime, already feels significantly better,\" he says.\nDJI's first 360-degree camera takes on other popular recorder like the GoPro Max and Insta360 X5. Gadget expert Adrian Kingsley-Hughes first tested the Osmo 360 in August ahead of its US debut, and he was throrouhly impressed. DJI makes popular drones, and the Osmo was its first attempt at a 360-degree camera. Kingsley-Hughes says DJI nailed it.\nAlso: I tried DJI's first 360-degree camera, and its recording capabilities blows out the competition\n\"This camera is a powerhouse,\" he says.\nAn iPad is a great tablet, and the 11th gen is our expert's pick for most poeple, which makes it highly giftable this year. \"Apple's 11th-generation iPad is still the best and most accessible tablet to date. And at this sale price, it makes the Pro that much harder to justify,\" expert Maria Diaz says.\nAlso: I've tested every iPad sold by Apple right now - here's the model I recommend most\nWhile the 11th Gen is packed with plenty of bells and whistles for casual users, Diaz says the only significant drawbacks of the new iPad are that it doesn't support Apple Intelligence, which requires an A17 Bionic chip or newer, and, unsurprisingly, it doesn't support the Apple Pencil Pro, which came out last year. These incompatibilities aren't a deal-breaker per se, but they're notable for those considering budgeting down to a standard iPad from an Air or Pro model and need to be aware of what's missing.\nAudio expert Jada Jones ranks these as the best premium headphones for everyday use. The XM6 feature an even more practical design, more advanced software features, and support for the LC3 Bluetooth codec, which is compatible with newer Samsung and Google Pixel phones.\nAlso: I traveled with the Sony XM6 headphones for a week - and can't go back\nThe XM6 also feature Sony's 360 Spatial Sound technology, the company's take on spatial audio. Jones says the XM6 are ideal for people who value sound and noise cancellation over style. Sony's headphones are wonderfully practical for commuting, traveling, and effectively blocking external noise.\nThe Skylight Calendar is a #1 Amazon bestseller for a reason. Smart home expert Maria Diaz says this wall-mounted smart calendar has been a game changer in her home, and that it makes a major difference.\nAlso: This wall-mounted smart calendar has been a game changer in my home\n\"The Skylight Calendar is a 15-inch smart display that looks like a high-end tablet. It runs an Android-based OS and displays a calendar at all times. The Calendar can be placed on a table or shelf, or mounted to the wall,\" Diaz says. \"Using the Skylight app on my phone, I can add events, chores, and dinner plans and create lists for everyone to see on the wall calendar within seconds.'\nIf you're searching for a tactile tablet for yourself or a loved one, look no further than ReMarkable's paper-like tablets. Expert Kyle Kucharski says the the ReMarkable Paper Pro delivers a premium pen-and-paper experience on a larger color display that has him never wanting to return to paper.\nAlso: I used ReMarkable's new colored E Ink tablet for two weeks - and can't go back to 'real' paper\nThough this tablet is truly remarkeable (pun intended), it is a whopping $679. It's most definitely for a serious E Ink tablet user, not a first-time explorer. Plus, you can also check out the smaller Paper Pro Move model for $499.\nExpert Alison DeNisco Rayome says the the De'Longhi Rivelia is going to have a permanent place in her kitchen.\nAlso: This fancy automatic espresso machine made me drop my Dunkin' habit - and it's on sale\nIf you're looking to get or gift for a way to level up the home coffee game, look no further than this model. It's a sleek, fully automatic espresso machine that makes it foolproof to make lattes, cappuccinos, flat whites, iced coffee, and much more. It is uber-pricey, but coffee connoisseurs likely won't be surprised to hear it.\nBut you pay for some elevated features. You'll find one button for coffee drinks and one for milk-based drinks, with 18 total options. Selections are made on an intuitive touchscreen with size and intensity options, too.\nWhen is Black Friday?\nBlack Friday always falls on the day after Thanksgiving in the US. This year, Black Friday is on Nov. 28, 2025.\nWhen is Cyber Monday?\nCyber Monday is the Monday following Thanksgiving weekend, and the end of the \"Cyber 5\" savings week. This year, Cyber Monday is on Dec. 1, 2025.",
