It's one of the best times of the year to score deep discounts on Chromebooks from major retailers like Best Buy, Walmart, and Amazon. Many of these sales are expected to carry over until Cyber Monday, which is on December 1.\nAre Chromebooks really cheaper during Black Friday?\nAbsolutely. Chromebooks are almost always cheaper on Black Friday and Cyber Week as a whole. Premium models with fast processors or 2-in-1 designs usually receive the best price cuts. They'll drop hundreds of dollars in price. Some of the midrange models even go below $200. Whether you're upgrading your old device or buying a lightweight laptop for travel, this shopping weekend is the best time to grab a Chromebook.\nHow did we choose these early Black Friday deals?\nAt ZDNET, we only highlight Chromebook deals worth your money -- the same kind we'd consider buying ourselves. For this roundup, I specifically sought out laptops that were 15% off or more. Black Friday is still several weeks away, so the big discounts aren't available yet. Knowing this, I expanded my search to include lesser discounts to fill out the list. Although some of the price drops aren't as deep as others, they're still worth consideration because they offer unique value in other areas.\nI took into consideration hands-on experience, real-world performance, and customer feedback. Every recommendation featured on this list is backed by careful research and expert insight, so you can shop these early Black Friday sales with confidence.",
