Ahead of the Nov. 28 shopping event, carriers like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile, have marked down a handful of phones at prices that you can expect to stick around as the weeks go by.\nAs always, you should read the fine print before throwing your wallet at your monitor (or at store associates), as most \"free phone\" or BOGO deals are often too good to be true. That's why I've broken down all the marketing lingo and complicated contracts below so you can find the promotion that works best for you.\nAlso: The best Black Friday deals live now\nI'll add that we only recommend phones that have gone through our rigorous testing methodologies, so all the picks mentioned on this list have been thoroughly inspected for their performance, endurance, unique features, and real-world benefits.\nBest early Black Friday Verizon deals\n- Current price: Taxes and fees\n- Original price: $1,800\nVerizon has been aggressively bundling multiple Apple products for \"On Us\" promotions, making them ideal for individuals interested in exploring Apple's ecosystem with faster-than-average data speeds. This latest one is for Unlimited Ultimate users who trade in an eligible device and open a service plan for the iPad that's bundled.\n- Current price: $900\n- Original price: $1,999\nFinally, I can confidently recommend Samsung's big-screen foldable phone to the masses, as this year's Z Fold 7 model features its thinnest (and hand-friendly) form factor yet. It's still expensive, with a retail price of $2,000, but this Verizon deal reduces the cost by more than 50%, provided you're on an Unlimited Ultimate plan and trade in a device as old as the Galaxy S22 (from 2022).\nReview: I spent a week in New York City with the Samsung Z Fold 7 - and it spoiled me the entire time\n- Current price: Taxes and fees\n- Original price: $830\nVerizon is also discounting most modern iPhone models, including the 16e and 17, by full, so long as you activate a new line under one of the carrier's Unlimited plans. You'll also have to agree to a 36-month installment plan, so a three-year commitment to Verizon.\nReview: iPhone 17\n- Current price: Taxes and fees\n- Original price: $3,320\nWhat's better than one iPhone 17? Four of them. That's how many Verizon will sell to you at no retail cost, but you'll have to add new lines under a qualifying Unlimited plan: Ultimate, Plus, or Welcome. Those plans start at $65 per month, and you'll have to commit to a 36-month installment plan. No trade-ins are required, and both new and existing users can qualify for the offer.\n- Current price: Taxes and fees\n- Original price: $340\nFor those looking to switch to one of Verizon's 5G Home Ultimate, LTE, Plus, 2 Gig, or 1 Gig plans, you may qualify for a free Nintendo Switch.\nAlthough it's not the second-generation model that has just been released, the popular gaming console remains a great incentive for users who want to enhance their home entertainment setup. You'll have to be a customer in \"good standing\" status for at least 65 days to get the gift.\nMore early Black Friday phone deals\n- Samsung Galaxy Ring: $300 (save $50): Verizon will knock off $50 when you purchase a Galaxy Ring alongside a qualifying Samsung device, including smartwatches, tablets, and phones.\n- iPhone 17 accessory bundle: $100 (save $50): The carrier has also discounted iPhone 17 (and Air) accessory bundles, which include a case, screen protector, and charger.\n- Google Pixel Buds Pro 2: $129 (save $100): Google's flagship earbuds can be purchased for only $129 when paired with the purchase of a recent Pixel phone model.\n- Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+: Free for 12 months (save $203): Qualifying Verizon Home Internet plan customers can get a year's worth of three streaming services for free.\n- Google Pixel 10: Free (save $800): With a qualifying Unlimited data plan and a new line activation, you can get the latest Google Pixel for free.\nFAQs\nWhen is Black Friday?\nBlack Friday is Friday, Nov. 28, the day after Thanksgiving. While it's typically associated with general retail sales, we're seeing a lot more online deals, as well. Cyber Monday, the traditional online shopping sale day, is Monday, Dec. 1. Both of these days will have some great deals, and there will be some overlap.\nAre phones really cheaper during Black Friday?\nYes, phones, including recent iPhone models, are often cheaper on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, matching (if not beating) the level of discount you'd find during any other major shopping event. This is partly because Cyber Week occurs months after most manufacturers, such as Samsung, OnePlus, Google, and Apple, have launched new devices. With the passage of time, you'll often see the more recent phones discounted by a significant amount at this time.\niPhones are cheaper during this time because carriers like Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T offer competitive trade-in and sign-on promotions. As long as you read the fine print about the qualifications, most of these deals will cover the retail cost of the new iPhone. You'll just have to agree to a long-term installment plan that ranges between 24 months to 36 months.\nHow did we choose these early Black Friday deals?\nZDNET chooses Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals based on the percentage of discount compared to the original price ($5 off a $20 item is just as good as $250 off a $1,000 item), how significant the discount is compared to pricing history, and whether our experts have tested and recommended the product.\nWe also examine deals from a broader perspective, considering alternative options, unique use cases, stock availability, and existing customer reviews on websites such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Reddit. The best deals will save you a meaningful amount of money while providing a truly worthwhile product.",
