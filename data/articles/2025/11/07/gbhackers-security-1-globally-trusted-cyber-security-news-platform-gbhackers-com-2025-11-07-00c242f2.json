      "full": "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which serves as Congress’s official financial advisor, has been targeted in a suspected cyberattack by suspected foreign actors.\nThe breach exposed sensitive financial research data that lawmakers rely on to make crucial budgeting decisions and craft legislation affecting millions of Americans.\nThe CBO confirmed the attack through an official agency spokeswoman, revealing that unauthorized individuals gained access to the organization’s systems.\nThis nonpartisan agency conducts some of the most critical financial analyses for the U.S. government, including budget projections, economic forecasts, and cost estimates for proposed legislation.\nWhat Data Was at Risk?\nThe exact scope of compromised data remains unclear. However, the CBO maintains extensive databases that contain detailed financial research, economic models, and budget analysis, which directly influence congressional decision-making.\nThis information is typically used to evaluate the financial impact of new legislation before votes occur. The loss of such sensitive information could give foreign adversaries insight into U.S. fiscal planning and legislative priorities.\nGovernment agencies are frequently targets of sophisticated cyberattacks because they hold vast amounts of valuable information and represent high-value targets for state-sponsored hackers.\nThe breach highlights the ongoing vulnerability of critical U.S. government infrastructure to advanced cyber threats.\nAuthorities launched an immediate investigation into the attack. The CBO is working with federal cybersecurity officials to determine the full extent of the breach, identify what information was accessed, and prevent similar incidents in the future.\nThe agency has not disclosed specific details about the attacker’s identity or the methods used to penetrate their systems.\nThis incident joins a growing list of cyberattacks targeting U.S. government agencies.\nPrevious breaches have compromised sensitive data across multiple departments, raising concerns about the adequacy of cybersecurity measures protecting critical government networks.\nThe attack underscores the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity protections across government agencies.\nCongress may face pressure to allocate additional funding for security upgrades and implement stricter protocols for handling sensitive financial data.\nThe incident serves as a stark reminder that even nonpartisan, essential government organizations remain vulnerable to sophisticated foreign cyber threats.\nFollow us on Google News, LinkedIn, and X to Get Instant Updates and Set GBH as a Preferred Source in Google.",
