    "raw": "Today, I noticed scans using the username &quot;FTP_3cx&quot; showing up in our logs. 3CX is a well-known maker of business phone system software [1]. My first guess was that this was a default user for one of their systems. But Google came up empty for this particular string. The 3CX software does not appear to run an FTP server, but it offers a feature to back up configurations to an FTP server [2]. The example user used in the documentation is &quot;3cxftpuser&quot;, not &quot;FTP_3cx&quot;. Additionally, the documentation notes that the FTP server can run on a different system from the 3CX software. For a backup, it would not make much sense to have it all run on the same system.",
