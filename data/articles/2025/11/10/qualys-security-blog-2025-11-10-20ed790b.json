    "raw": "Once upon a time, your biggest worry was whether Dave in Accounting would click on a suspicious link. Today, you wish Dave were your only worry. You’re likely balancing four major clouds, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle, plus on-premises, hybrid environments, thousands of ephemeral workloads, containers, and serverless functions spinning up and down by the second. Meanwhile, the alphabet soup of compliance mandates never stops growing: NIST CSF 2.0, DORA, NIS2, PCI DSS 4.0, ISO 27001, SOC 2, HIPAA 2023, GDPR, CIS, DoD Zero Trust, etc. By the time you read this, there’s probably a new one on your plate. Your board? They expect you to reduce risk. Regulators? They expect proof. Auditors? They want customized compliance reports. Yesterday. Meanwhile, you’re struggling to answer several key questions: How do you prioritize which misconfigurations and vulnerabilities matter most? How do you automate creating service actions and misconfiguration remediation? How do you demonstrate to auditors that you have resolved any issues and are now compliant? Misconfigurations are the leading cause of cloud breaches, responsible for over 81% of incidents, and can lead to failed audits. And cloud drift is relentless. Every new cloud service launches with its own settings, quirks, and vulnerabilities, each with its own chance to expose you. Traditional scanners aren’t enough. They’re great for catching CVEs and patch gaps, but cloud security posture demands continuous configuration checks, contextualized risk triage, and instant remediation that scales. Miss something? You might fail an audit, lose customer trust, or find yourself on the wrong side of a regulator. Manual won’t cut it, and neither will tribal knowledge or procrastination. This is why Qualys and ServiceNow have joined forces to offer Qualys TotalCloud CSPM with ServiceNow Configuration Compliance, enabling you to stay ahead of misconfigurations, risk drift, and compliance chaos. Qualys Solutions Seamlessly Integrate with ServiceNow The new configuration compliance integration represents the next evolution of our longstanding partnership with ServiceNow, building upon our proven track record of delivering seamless security operations through the ServiceNow platform. Now you can simplify your cloud security operations with the intelligent integration of Qualys TotalCloud CSPM with ServiceNow Configuration Compliance to automate prioritization workflows for misconfiguration triage and remediation. Cloud compliance automation uses integrated tools to continuously monitor cloud environments against security frameworks, identify misconfigurations, and trigger automated remediation workflows. The integration between Qualys TotalCloud CSPM and ServiceNow streamlines this process by unifying risk detection with IT service management, enabling teams to fix compliance issues faster and maintain a constant state of audit-readiness. Additional ServiceNow integrations supported by Qualys include: Qualys Vulnerability Response (VR) Our flagship vulnerability management integration transforms how organizations handle vulnerability lifecycle management. By synchronizing vulnerability data directly into ServiceNow, teams can create automated workflows for patch management, risk assessment, and remediation tracking. Qualys Container Vulnerability Response (CVR) Designed specifically for cloud-native environments, CVR extends our vulnerability management capabilities to container workloads and images. This integration provides real-time visibility into container vulnerabilities, enabling DevOps and security teams to address risks before they reach production environments. Qualys CMDB Integration Our CMDB integration ensures that asset discovery and inventory management remain accurate and up-to-date. By automatically populating their ServiceNow CMDB with asset information from Qualys scans, organizations maintain a single source of truth for their IT infrastructure while reducing manual data entry and improving operational efficiency. Qualys AVR Integration The ServiceNow Application Vulnerability Response (AVR) app helps you view all your application vulnerability on a single page. With Qualys AVR integration, you can view data from the Qualys platform on the ServiceNow Application Vulnerability Response page. How the Qualys and ServiceNow Integration Automates Cloud Compliance Complete Multi-Cloud Inventory &amp; Discovery Qualys TotalCloud CSPM taps directly into your cloud APIs across AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI to ensure full visibility into virtually every cloud service across compute, network, identity, storage, and AI. Also, VMs, containers, serverless functions, and ephemeral resources. No shadow IT. No blind spots. Continuous Configuration Assessments with Customizable Checks Qualys runs continuous configuration checks mapped to dozens of frameworks, including ISO 27001, NIST CSF 2.0, CIS Controls, PCI DSS 4.0, HIPAA 2023, GDPR, DoD Zero Trust, and many more. Plus, you can customize checks to match your internal policies or industry nuances. If it drifts, you know instantly. Multi-Dimensional Risk Prioritization Not all risks are equal. Qualys contextually prioritizes misconfigurations by real business impact, so your teams don’t waste time chasing low-level noise. Now you can focus efforts where they count. Seamless ServiceNow Integration: Instant Triage &amp; Mobilization Rich Qualys risk data flows straight into ServiceNow’s Configuration Compliance, Vulnerability Response, Container Vulnerability Response, and your CMDB. Issues are automatically translated into clear, actionable triage Monitoring of risk posture and remediation of meaningful risk is addressed Tickets are routed to the right owners Exception workflows and approvals are built in Full audit trails ensure nothing slips through the cracks When your team remediates the misconfiguration, ServiceNow automatically closes the ticket and updates your compliance dashboards Always-Updated CMDB Your ServiceNow CMDB stays clean and accurate, thanks to Qualys auto-populating asset and config details. Your teams get a single source of truth, without manual data chasing. Go Beyond Triage to Automated Remediation with Qualys Flow Playbooks Qualys pairs real-time detection with real action.
