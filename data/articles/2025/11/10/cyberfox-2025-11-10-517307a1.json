    "raw": "Passwords have been the backbone of cybersecurity for decades. But they&#8217;ve also become one of its biggest weaknesses. Studies show 81% of breaches involve weak or stolen credentials. As identity threats become more sophisticated, from phishing and credential theft to privilege misuse and supply-chain compromise, many organizations are exploring a new approach: passwordless authentication. What is passwordless authentication? And how does it work? Passwordless authentication is a way for users to log in to systems, devices, and tools without using their credentials. Instead of typing something they know (like a password), the system verifies something they have or are. Passwordless authentication examples include hardware security keys or biometric factors like a fingerprint or facial recognition. How passwordless authentication works When you enable passwordless authentication, each user&#8217;s trusted device (for example, their laptop or phone) is registered with your organization&#8217;s identity provider, such as Azure AD or Okta During that setup, the trusted device creates two digital keys: one private and one public. The private key stays on the device, while the public key is securely stored in the directory for that user&#8217;s account, where it&#8217;s used later to verify logins. When the user signs in, the system sends a login request to the registered device. The device uses its private key to securely answer that request. The system checks the answer using the matching public key and, if everything lines up, grants access. Because the private key never leaves the device and can&#8217;t be reused elsewhere, attackers can&#8217;t intercept or steal it the way they can a password. Real-world examples of passwordless authentication Logging into Microsoft 365 with a fingerprint or Windows Hello instead of a password Using a YubiKey or phone as a passkey to approve access to Google Workspace or Okta Using Okta FastPass to log into corporate apps with a verified device and biometric check instead of a password The case for passwordless authentication (AKA why passwords are your organization&#8217;s weakest cybersecurity link) No matter how many numbers and special characters you use, there&#8217;s risk associated with even the strongest password. And we have good ole human error to blame. Users reuse passwords. They store their passwords in their browser. They share them with convincing-looking AI-generated LinkedIn profiles. And once an attacker gets their little hacker paws on a stolen password, they have free rein in your company network. They can move into your payroll, HR, and other important systems, elevate privileges, and wreak havoc. Passwordless authentication doesn&#8217;t just make life easier for your users. It helps strengthen your organization&#8217;s overall security posture. Is passwordless authentication safe? Short answer: Yes, when done right. Passwordless authentication is designed to solve one of cybersecurity&#8217;s biggest problems: compromised passwords. Instead of depending on credentials that can be shared, guessed, or reused, it verifies identity through encrypted device-based keys. Long answer: Passwordless authentication is only as strong as the controls around it. Devices need to be properly managed and protected with biometrics or PINs. Recovery options should be secure, so lost devices don&#8217;t become a new entry point for attackers. And IT teams still need visibility into who has access and how these devices are used. When those prices are in place, passwordless authentication helps reduce phishing attacks, limit credential theft, and make identity verification smoother and more secure for users. Why most organizations end up taking a hybrid approach to credential management Even with all the buzz around passwordless authentication, most organizations can&#8217;t go all-in just yet. Legacy systems, privileged accounts, and compliance requirements still depend on passwords in some workflows. That&#8217;s why many IT environments take a hybrid approach. They use passwordless methods for modern apps and identity systems, but still rely on traditional credentials where needed. In those cases, the right security controls keep everything consistent. That includes managing how users access the systems that can&#8217;t yet support passwordless logins. Passwordless may be the future, but hybrid identity management is the current reality. The goal is not to remove every password overnight. It&#8217;s to protect every access point with the right level of control. Making passwordless part of your security roadmap Moving towards passwordless authentication is a strategic process, not a one-off project. It takes planning, testing, and a clear understanding of how it fits into your broader cybersecurity strategy. Our top tip? Start with the tools that already support passwordless authentication, such as Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, or your identity provider&#8217;s admin portal. You can also pilot it with groups that handle fewer legacy systems, like finance or HR, before expanding to technical or operations teams. Each step should build on your existing access controls and device management policies so nothing falls through the cracks. Passwordless isn&#8217;t a replacement for everything else you do to protect access. It&#8217;s an additional layer that helps reduce the number of passwords in play and lowers the risk of credential theft. Ready to strengthen how your team manages access? Passwordless authentication is changing how organizations think about identity. It makes verification faster, simpler, and harder to compromise. And when it&#8217;s introduced alongside strong access controls it helps build the kind of layered defense that modern environments demand.
