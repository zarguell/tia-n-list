    "raw": "The federal cybersecurity system is weathering a series of crises that couldn’t have arrived at a worse time. The F5 security breach from Oct. 15, the proposed elimination of more than 1,000 jobs at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the ongoing federal government shutdown have created a perfect storm that is not only leaving critical vulnerabilities exposed across the nation’s digital infrastructure, but it’s also weakening the workforce meant to defend it.

Or under normal conditions, this reactive approach would be an uphill battle. But, as most of us now know, CISA is facing potential cuts of more than 1,000 positions and funding cuts totaling nearly half a billion dollars.
