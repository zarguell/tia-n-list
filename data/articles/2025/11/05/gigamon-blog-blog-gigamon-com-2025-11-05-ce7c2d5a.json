    "raw": "Quantum computing is not a distant risk; it is a ticking clock. As the race toward post-quantum cryptography (PQC) accelerates, organizations must act now to safeguard the encrypted data moving across hybrid and multi-cloud environments before it becomes vulnerable to future quantum attacks. Preparing for this shift requires more than deploying new cryptographic algorithms. It demands a complete understanding of where cryptography is used, how data flows between systems, and which assets remain exposed. That level of insight is only possible through deep observability. Today, Gigamon announced that we’re addressing these challenges with innovative solutions specifically designed to streamline the transition to PQC, offering the visibility required to help organizations build secure and future-ready systems in the face of quantum threats. What Deep Observability Is and Why It Matters for PQC Deep observability is the efficient delivery of network-derived telemetry—packets, flows, and metadata—that provides actionable guidance to security, cloud, and IT operations teams. It extends beyond traditional metrics, events, logs, and traces to reveal what is actually happening within network traffic, both encrypted and unencrypted. By providing this level of intelligence, deep observability exposes weak cipher suites, expired certificates, and non-compliant encryption methods that often remain hidden in encrypted flows. It helps organizations build a complete cryptographic inventory, validate PQC implementations, and ensure that encryption, whether classical or quantum-safe, operates securely and efficiently. Deep observability transforms PQC readiness from a theoretical goal into a measurable and verifiable security strategy. Gigamon Expertise: A Proven Foundation for PQC Readiness Gigamon has long been trusted to help organizations secure and manage hybrid cloud infrastructure. We have deep expertise in encryption, decryption, and network intelligence, with decades of experience supporting industry standards and helping enterprises evolve as new ones emerge. This foundation makes Gigamon a natural enabler of PQC readiness. The Gigamon Deep Observability Pipeline delivers network-derived telemetry from across hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure, empowering existing security and observability tools with actionable context. As post-quantum cryptography standards mature, this same capability provides unparalleled insight into cryptographic posture and transition progress. Through the Gigamon Deep Observability Pipeline, organizations can: Map cryptographic use across hybrid and multi-cloud environments to locate systems still relying on pre-quantum algorithms and identify where PQC pilots are underway Monitor PQC performance and reliability by analyzing network telemetry that reveals encrypted traffic behavior in real time, without decrypting payloads Detect vulnerabilities early, such as weak cipher suites, expired certificates, and non-compliant encryption implementations Optimize performance and scalability as PQC algorithms increase computational demands, ensuring that new encryption methods do not introduce latency or blind spots By turning network telemetry into actionable guidance, Gigamon helps organizations make PQC adoption secure, efficient, and aligned with governance standards. Four Steps to Protect PQC Environments Using Deep Observability The transition to PQC will require careful coordination across tools, teams, and technologies. The following steps, illustrated in the diagram below, outline how deep observability enables a successful PQC strategy: At the center of PQC readiness is complete network visibility. The Gigamon Deep Observability Pipeline enables organizations to execute four critical steps: Advanced monitoring – Conduct granular traffic analysis to identify cryptographic use across all network segments and detect vulnerabilities before they create exposure AI and machine learning analysis – Apply intelligent pattern recognition to identify anomalies, emerging threats, and performance inefficiencies within encrypted and PQC traffic Cross-team collaboration – Align IT, security, and compliance teams through shared telemetry and unified visibility, ensuring consistent policy enforcement and strategic decision-making System updates and validation – Continuously track evolving encryption protocols and standards to confirm that PQC algorithms are deployed correctly and performing as intended Each of these steps is essential to building a quantum-safe environment that is resilient, efficient, and fully observable from core to cloud. Building a Quantum-Safe Future with Deep Observability The global transition to PQC will unfold over several years as new standards are finalized and enterprises adapt. Deep observability ensures that every phase of this transformation is visible, measurable, and verifiable. It enables organizations to understand cryptographic health, validate PQC performance, and demonstrate compliance with emerging regulations. The long-standing innovation Gigamon delivers in encryption visibility and network intelligence has made the company a trusted partner for organizations preparing for the quantum era. By turning network telemetry into actionable insight, Gigamon helps enterprises secure their hybrid cloud environments today while building a resilient foundation for tomorrow’s quantum-safe future. In the race to protect systems and data from quantum-enabled threats, deep observability is not just a capability: It is the key to readiness, resilience, and digital trust.
