But is that actually true? I'm a longtime Google Maps (and Google Earth) user. I swear by the app, and I regularly side-eye anyone who says otherwise (especially, god forbid, Apple Maps users.\nAlso: You can chat with Google Maps now, thanks to this big AI upgrade - how it works\nI'm also a tech editor, though, which means I do my best to set aside personal bias in the name of journalism. Every now and then, I force myself to try alternative navigation apps -- and that includes Waze, which, in case you didn't know, Google acquired in 2013.\nSo, if you're looking for a true feature-by-feature breakdown of how Waze compares to Google Maps, you've come to the right place. I've tried both, and I'm here to tell you which one really gets you where you need to go faster, smarter, and better.\nIs Waze or Google Maps better?\nLet's analyze all the major features to determine a clear winner. Will the final scorecard surprise us both? Maybe.\nNavigation with real-time rerouting\nWinner: Waze, for getting you from A to B the fastest\nWaze is for people who want to get where they are going, fast.\nIt prioritizes the quickest route and will automatically reroute you the second traffic gets messy. There's no asking for permission... it just does it, even if it means taking you down a weird side street.\nGoogle Maps, on the other hand, takes a more measured approach. It considers things like road types and even fuel efficiency for different vehicle types. It's also getting smarter: Google Maps can now use landmarks in directions instead of just distances, so you might hear \"Turn left after the Shell station,\" rather than \"Turn left in 600 feet.\" It'll suggest a faster route if one pops up, but you have to tap to approve.\nAlso: How to share your location on Android quickly - via text or Google Maps\nPersonally, I like having the final say. If an app wants to reroute me last-minute, I'd rather know where I'm headed (and approve it) before I take the turn. But if your top priority is shaving off seconds, Waze is the way to go. I'll give this one to Waze for that alone, but it's close.\nPublic transit and other travel modes\nWinner: Google Maps, for walking, biking, the bus, and more\nWaze is just for drivers. Literally. Like, people driving cars or motorcycles. There's no using it for walking, biking, buses, or trains. Basically, if you're not behind the wheel, Waze can't help you. Google Maps, however, has it all. Whether you're headed somewhere on foot or figuring out a multi-leg public transit trip, it's got detailed routes, live schedules, and real-time updates.\nTraffic and incident reporting\nWinner: Waze, for its longtime offering of driver-led data\nWaze has long stood out for its live, driver-submitted information that helps it decide how to reroute you in real time. Users can report everything from traffic jams and road hazards to construction, speed traps, and even bad weather. As you drive, you can confirm or dismiss alerts to help keep the map accurate and up to date.\nLately, though, Google Maps has been catching up. It now also lets users report crashes, slowdowns, road closures, speed traps, and even lane blockages. These reports show up on the map, which is helpful.\nBut, unlike Waze, Google Maps won't automatically reroute you based on that real-time info. If something pops up ahead, it's on you to decide whether to take a detour or stick with the original route.\nAlso: 6 Google Maps tricks to try for the navigation app's 20th birthday\nSince Waze has offered robust real-time reporting from the very beginning, I'll give it the win here, but it could just as easily be a tie at this point. Google Maps has come a long way, with the gap between the two getting smaller.\nPolice and speed trap alerts\nWinner: Waze, for more detailed reporting\nThis is one of the areas where Waze has really made its name.\nThe app has long let users report police sightings (including when they're hiding) along with things like mobile phone detection cameras. Google Maps has started to catch up with basic reporting tools, but it's still not as detailed. For example, there's no option to flag mobile phone detection zones yet.\nSince Waze was the forerunner here and offers more granular, real-time alerts, it takes the win in this category.\nOffline maps and data use\nWinner: Google Maps, for letting you download maps\nWaze needs a data connection for pretty much everything. It'll cache your route a bit if you start with a signal, but once you're offline, you're mostly out of luck. No live updates, no rerouting, and limited functionality.\nGoogle Maps is a lot more offline-friendly. You can download entire regions ahead of time, complete with turn-by-turn directions, which makes it a total lifesaver when you're in the middle of nowhere or traveling abroad.\nInterface and design\nWinner: Google Maps, for its rich discovery options\nWaze definitely has a personality, thanks to its colorful, cartoony design packed with big icons and bold, in-your-face alerts. It's also got a playful side when it comes to customization. You can stream music directly through the built-in audio player (Spotify, anyone?), pick a voice \"sidekick\" like Halo's Master Chief or comedian Nate Bargatze, and even set a mood once you've driven more than 160 kilometers.\nGoogle Maps isn't quite as caricatured, but it is loaded with features. It's fantastic for exploring neighborhoods, digging into business info, or finding restaurants, parks, and stores. You can even hop into Street View to preview a location before heading out. There are plenty of layers and details too.\nYou can switch between satellite, terrain, air quality, wildfire zones, and even 3D buildings. Now it even has an AR-powered Lens feature that lets you use your phone's camera to identify shops, restaurants, or landmarks around you and get quick AI-powered info on them. It might feel a little cluttered when you're just trying to drive, but honestly, it's kind of fun to click around and see just how much it can do.\nAlso: How to blur your house on Google Street View (and 4 reasons why people do it)\nWhile Waze has basic details like business addresses and hours, what about restaurant reviews or photos? Not so much. Google Maps is a beast in this department. Full reviews, photos, peak hours, menus, and more.\nI'll admit this can come down to personal preference. If you're into quirky extras and playful design, Waze definitely delivers. But since I'm not big on the gimmicky stuff and prefer a more feature-rich interface with plenty of discovery options that actually help me get around, I'm giving the edge to Google Maps.\nAI voice assistance\nWinner: Google Maps, for deeper Gemini integration\nWaze has a \"Conversational reporting\" feature powered by Gemini that lets you say things like \"Looks jammed ahead\" to report a traffic jam without tapping anything. This is great for hands-free updates while driving.\nAlso: How to turn off Gemini in your Gmail, Photos, Chrome, and more - it's easy to opt out of AI\nBut Google Maps has gone even further with its new Gemini AI upgrade. It's like a super-smart copilot. You can ask Google Maps to find a budget-friendly vegan restaurant along your route (and see if it has parking), or have it add a reminder to your calendar, or even get it to share your ETA with a friend, all without touching your phone.\nIt also gives more natural directions now by using landmarks. I love having this level of deep integration throughout the app, rather than just an AI for reporting, so Google Maps wins this one.\nAvailability and compatibility\nWinner: Google Maps, for slightly broader reach\nBoth apps are available globally on iOS, Android, Android Auto, and Apple CarPlay. But Google Maps is preinstalled on most Android phones and comes baked into the Android Automotive OS, so it wins here.\nThe final scorecard\nLet's tally up which navigation app is the winner, based on the key features above and whether they offer them or do it better.\n| Category | Winner | Why it wins |\n|---|---|---|\n| Navigation and rerouting | Waze | Instantly reroutes you based on real-time traffic (no permission needed). |\n| Transit and travel modes | Google Maps | Supports walking, biking, buses, trains, and more. |\n| Traffic and incident reporting | Waze (near tie) | Real-time, driver-powered alerts with live confirmation and rerouting. |\n| Police and speed trap alerts | Waze | More detailed reports, including hidden police and mobile phone detection. |\n| Offline maps and data use | Google Maps | Full offline map downloads with turn-by-turn directions. |\n| Interface and design | Google Maps (near tie) | Richer toolset: Street View, map layers, business info, etc. |\n| AI voice assistance | Google Maps (near tie) | Gemini is live in both apps, but it's more fully integrated in Google Maps. |\n| Availability and compatibility | Google Maps | Preinstalled on Android, works across more platforms out of the box. |\nTotal:\n- Waze: 3 wins\n- Google Maps: 5 wins\nAnd there you have it, folks. Google Maps edges out Waze by two categories. That said, a few of these could've easily gone either way, and a lot of it really comes down to personal preference. Still, if you want my take (and let's be honest, if you've made it this far, you probably do): Google Maps is a seriously feature-rich app, and any gaps between it and Waze are shrinking fast.\nFAQs\nWhen should you use Waze over Google Maps?\nIf you care most about avoiding traffic, hazards, and speed traps, Waze is built for that. It's faster at rerouting and more focused on the driver's needs. Here's quick decision tree if you're on the fence about which app to use and when.\nAlso: This hidden Google Maps feature is making people emotional - here's why\nUse Waze if...\n- You're driving and want the fastest possible route.\n- You love seeing live, detailed road alerts (speed traps, hazards, cops).\n- You enjoy customizing your experience (fun voices, avatars).\n- You don't need walking, biking, or transit directions.\nUse Google Maps if...\n- You take public transit, walk, or bike.\n- You want detailed business info and reviews.\n- You want to use Street View and its historical timeline feature.\n- You travel internationally or need offline maps.\n- You want to use deep Gemini-powered AI voice assistance.\nCan Waze be used offline?\nNot really. Waze requires a data connection to function properly. It might cache part of a route but doesn't offer true offline maps like Google Maps does.\nDoes Google Maps show police like Waze?\nGoogle Maps has some basic reporting tools for things like police, but it's not as detailed as Waze's real-time, user-generated alerts.\nCan you use Waze for walking or biking?\nNo. Waze is strictly for drivers. If you're walking, biking, or taking transit, use Google Maps.\nDoes Waze have Street View or historical timeline data?\nNo. Waze doesn't support Street View or historical timeline data. If you want to visually explore a location before you go (like seeing what a building entrance looks like or checking parking availability), you'll need to use Google Maps, which offers full Street View integration. Google Maps also allows you to go back in time to see a place as it looked in the past (up to 20 years ago).\nDoes Google Maps or Waze have an Incognito mode?\nYes. Google Maps has an Incognito mode that lets you browse and navigate without saving your activity to your Google account, so your searches, routes, and visited places aren't recorded in your location history or personalized recommendations. Waze doesn't have a true Incognito mode, but you can go \"invisible\" by hiding your live location and username from other drivers.\nAlso: I ditched Google Maps for this free alternative that doesn't track me - or drain my battery\nTo enable Incognito Mode in Google Maps, tap your profile photo and select \"Turn on Incognito mode.\" Meanwhile, in Waze, tap Menu > View Profile > Go invisible to hide.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter.",
