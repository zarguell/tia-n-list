Black Friday is always the day after Thanksgiving in the US, a holiday that is celebrated on the last Thursday in November. Many employers have historically given workers the Friday after Thanksgiving as a day off, so retailers started featuring discounts to encourage people to do their holiday shopping.\nAre Target deals really cheaper during Black Friday?\nTarget offers the best discounts of the year during Black Friday, with most of them starting at 40% off. Most major retailers in the US offer significant discounts during Black Friday to compete with one another, and Target is no exception. Many of Target's best deals will start at 60% off, so many products will reach their lowest price ever during Black Friday; it's just a matter of catching them before they're sold out.\nHow did we choose these early Black Friday deals?\nAs a full-time tech writer and reviewer, I'm constantly monitoring prices on devices as part of my work, so\nI'm always looking for the best combinations of worthwhile features and great value. I review gadgets, tablets, smart home technology, and robot vacuums for ZDNET, so I've become well-acquainted with price fluctuations.\nAt ZDNET, we use our expertise and deal-tracking tools to identify the offers that are truly worth your attention -- and only highlight those.",
