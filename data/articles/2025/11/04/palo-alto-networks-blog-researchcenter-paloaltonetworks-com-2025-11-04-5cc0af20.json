    "raw": "Branch offices are the heartbeat of the distributed enterprise. From retail stores and healthcare clinics to manufacturing floors, these locations are where your business connects with customers, partners and guests. They rely on a dynamic mix of devices (e.g., laptops, smartphones, Point of Sale (PoS) terminals, IoT sensors) all requiring secure, seamless access to applications anywhere, anytime. The traditional branch, a static outpost tethered to a central data center, can no longer keep pace. With 70% of organizations now embracing a hybrid cloud strategy, the modern branch has transformed into a dynamic hub connecting to applications everywhere. This branch evolution demands Prisma SASE as its modern blueprint for security. Yet, the traditional network simply wasn't built for this scale or speed of change. It's often a patchwork of legacy appliances and fragmented policies, designed to connect buildings, not to empower a hybrid workforce that scales across a multicloud world. This approach is not just complex and slow; it comes with security vulnerabilities and performance challenges. It’s time for a smarter way forward, one that can see, learn and protect at the speed of your business. The Modern Branch Has a Checklist of Critical Security Needs A modern branch is a living ecosystem, changing with new devices and users. Your security can't be a static wall; it needs to be an intelligent dynamic system. It must be built on zero trust: Trusting nothing, verifying everything. If your security can't do this, chances are that it has already failed or is likely to fail in the coming future. Here’s what your organization should have for a robust branch security: Branch Segmentation – Gain complete visibility and control over all branch traffic to block unauthorized lateral movement between devices and help protect sensitive data. Secure Access – Internet &amp; Cloud Access – Give employees and contractors fast, secure access to web and cloud applications while protecting them from internet-borne threats. Private Access – Enable fast, secure access to private applications in data centers or public clouds, helping prevent data exfiltration and the spread of internal threats. Guest Access – Provide internet access for guests that adheres to corporate policy while strictly isolating them from the corporate network. Automated Internet of Things (IoT) Security – Instantly discover, profile and lock down every connected device, from printers to industrial sensors. Automatically enforce least-privileged access policies that control and log all communications against prebuilt device-specific baseline behavior profiles. Why Traditional Branch Security Falls Short If your branch security feels like a constant uphill battle, you’re not alone. The traditional approach is fundamentally broken, forcing organizations into a no-win situation. Figure 1: Traditional network security struggles with siloed solutions that are inadequate to solve problems of any modern day enterprise. First is the need to deploy, manage and refresh dedicated network and security hardware at every single branch, which is often operationally and financially impractical. The second and more critical challenge is operational complexity. You have a patchwork of different security products that don't talk to each other, making a unifying security policy impossible. Every new tool adds another layer of complexity and another potential point of failure in this scenario: Not only are the policies fragmented, but security controls are also distributed, which is a combination that can reduce efficacy and increase the logging burden. IoT devices are poorly segmented with their sensitive traffic not being monitored, opening up vulnerable IoT devices as an attack entry point. Organizations implement IP-based microsegmentation strategies that are overly complex and a challenge to maintain while delivering business agility. This approach isn't just unscalable; it's brittle, destined to collapse under the weight of modern demands. Get Best-in-Class Branch Security, Radically Simplified Prisma SD-WAN’s Intelligence and Protection Built into the Branch To solve these challenges, security must be intelligently distributed and enforced in the right place built into the SD-WAN device for local enforcement, while seamlessly integrating with the cloud for advanced, scalable protection. Prisma SD-WAN devices are built with this principle in mind, delivering best-in-class connectivity and foundational zero trust security at the branch edge. This is built with seamless integration with Prisma Access and data center firewalls to extend advanced cloud-delivered security across the entire network. Prisma SD-WAN’s built-in intelligence allows you to handle critical security scenarios instantly and efficiently, without adding more boxes or complexity. Figure 2: Secure branch for east-west traffic, guest traffic. Identity-Aware Zero Trust: Enforce granular policies based on User-ID, Device-ID and App-ID, moving beyond legacy subnet rules to control access with precision. Granular Segmentation: Contain threats by enforcing security between users, devices and zones, effectively stopping lateral movement within the branch. Threat Protection for Different Kinds of Access: Leverage the same industry-leading services offered by CDSS, such as URL Filtering, DNS Security and Threat Prevention services directly on-box to protect east-west traffic and securely offload local guest traffic. Automated IoT Discovery: Automatically find and classify all connected devices, allowing you to instantly apply identity-based security policies to eliminate rogue device threats. Prisma SASE’s Power of a Unified Platform True enterprise security requires context, seeing how the branch, remote users and your cloud environments all interact. This is where the power of a unified platform becomes transformative. Prisma SASE elevates your strategy from securing a single location to securing your entire organization as one cohesive entity, ensuring that your security posture is consistent, gap-free and context-aware, no matter where your users or applications reside. Figure 3: Deliver best-of-breed user experience and branch security with the convergence of networking and security. Unified Visibility and Management: Strata Cloud Manager provides a single, intuitive console for monitoring all branches, data centers and remote user activity. No more juggling dashboards or struggling to correlate security events. Unified Policy Enforcement: Apply one consistent zero trust security policy (i.e., URL, DNS, TP) across your entire enterprise. Policies leverage the same User-ID, Device-ID and App-ID context everywhere, eliminating inconsistencies and reducing errors. Unified Cloud Security Services: Both Prisma SD-WAN and Prisma Access are continuously updated by our Palo Alto Networks Cloud-Delivered Security Services. This ensures all your defenses have the latest threat intelligence automatically, with minimal manual effort. Figure 4: Comprehensive monitoring and actionable visibility across the enterprise.
