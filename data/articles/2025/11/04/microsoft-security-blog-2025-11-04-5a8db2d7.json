    "raw": "The busier security teams get, the harder it can be to understand the full impact of false positives, queue clutter, tool fragmentation, and more. But what is clear—it all adds up to increased fatigue and an increased potential to miss the cyberthreats that matter most. To help security teams better face the growing challenges, generative AI offers transformative capabilities that can bridge critical gaps. In a newly released e-book from Microsoft, we share multiple scenarios that showcase how Microsoft Security Copilot, powered by generative AI, can empower security analysts, accelerate incident response, and improve operational inefficiencies. Sign up to get the e-book, From Alert Fatigue to Proactive Defense: What Generative AI Can Do for Your SOC, and learn how AI can transform organizations like yours today. Learn what generative AI can do for your security operations Figure 1. Key statistics on the realities of today&rsquo;s security operations center (SOCs). Enhance every stage of the security operations workflow The teams we talk to mention how generative AI is dramatically improving the efficacy and efficiency of their security operations (SecOps)—it helps analysts triage alerts by correlating threat intelligence and surfacing related activity that might not trigger a traditional alert. It generates rapid incident summaries so teams can get started faster, guides investigations with step-by-step context and evidence, and automates routine response tasks like containment and remediation through AI-powered playbooks. Additionally, generative AI supports proactive threat hunting by suggesting queries that uncover lateral movement or privilege escalation, and streamlines reporting by producing clear, audience-ready summaries for stakeholders, all of which means SOC teams spend less time on manual, repetitive work and more time focusing on high-impact cyberthreats—ultimately allowing for faster, smarter, and more resilient security operations. Microsoft Security Copilot helps organizations address critical challenges of scale, complexity, and inefficiencies—as well as streamlining investigations, simplifying reporting, and more. It gives analysts a good idea of where to start, how to prioritize, and improves analyst confidence with actionable insights. By embedding generative AI into existing workflows, SOCs can operationalize and contextualize security data in ways never possible before—delivering guided responses, accelerating investigations, and transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights for both technical teams and business leaders. Organizations using Security Copilot report a 30% reduction in mean time to resolution (MTTR).5 Discover more with Microsoft Security Copilot How Security Copilot delivers real value in everyday SOC tasks The e-book spans four chapters that cover key scenarios, including investigation and response, AI-powered analysis, proactive threat hunting, and simplified security reporting. Each chapter presents the core challenges faced by today’s SOC teams, how generative AI accelerates and improves outcomes, and measurable, real-world results that show improvements for security analysts—like reduced noise, faster critical insights, identified cyberattack paths, and audience-ready summaries generated by AI. For example, when an analyst receives alerts about unusual login activity from multiple geolocations targeting a high-privilege account, generative AI consolidates related alerts, prioritizes the incident, and provides actionable summaries, allowing for faster triage and confident response. Included in the e-book are summaries of AI in action, with step-by-step explanations of how Copilot is: Guiding analysts to confident, rapid decisions—helping SOC analysts quickly triage alerts, summarize incidents, recommend precise actions, and guide responses, for faster, more confident threat containment. Turning complex scripts into clear insights—supporting SOC analysts to decode malicious scripts, correlate threat intelligence, and automate investigations. Anticipating cyberthreats before they escalate—empowering threat hunters to quickly query indicators of compromise (IOCs), uncover hidden cyberattack patterns, and take proactive actions, for more predictive defense against evolving cyberthreats. Simplifying security reporting for analysts–letting SOC analysts to instantly consolidate data, capture critical details, and produce clear, audience-ready reports. We analyze results about 60% to 70% faster with Security Copilot. It plays a central role in our ability to speed up threat analyses and activities, fundamentally reducing the risks for our IT landscape worldwide. —Norbert Vetter, Chief Information Security Officer, TÜV SÜD The future of SecOps is here with generative AI For security leaders looking to improve their response time and better support their teams, generative AI isn’t just a vision for the future—it’s available today. From triage to reporting, generative AI–powered assistants enhance every stage of the SecOps workflow—delivering faster responses, stronger defenses, and more confident decision-making. At the forefront of this transformation is Microsoft Security Copilot, which unifies tools, operationalizes threat intelligence, and guides analysts through complex workflows, letting SOC teams adapt to evolving cyberthreats with ease.
