      "full": "Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters (SLH), previously observed hinting at an extortion-as-a-service offering and testing “Sh1nySp1d3r” ransomware, has now been identified not just as a loose collaboration but as a coordinated alliance blending Scattered Spider, ShinyHunters and LAPSUS$ under a shared operational banner.\nIn a new advisory published today, Trustwave SpiderLabs reported the group is positioning itself as a federated collective. This development moves beyond earlier indications of tactical experimentation noted in October by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42.\nWhat is new is confirmation that this entity is deliberately merging reputational capital from three high-profile criminal brands to create a unified threat identity.\nThe actors are not simply resurfacing after law-enforcement pressure or temporarily rebranding; they are presenting a consolidated front with a centralized narrative, operational marketing model and named “Operations Centre.”\nTrustwave identified fewer than five core operators behind roughly 30 personas, with ShinyHunters-linked identities appearing to lead the structure.\nTelegram as Command Stage\nWhile Unit 42 previously observed Telegram chatter signaling EaaS plans, the latest analysis reveals Telegram’s broader role as a permanent command hub and brand engine, not just a broadcast channel.\nSince early August, the group has cycled through at least 16 public channels, rebuilding them within hours of each takedown.\nThis resilience underscores a strategy rooted in public presence and intimidation, with theatrical tactics similar to hacktivist behavior – though Trustwave emphasizes the group remains financially motivated.\nRead more on Telegram-based extortion tactics: Telegram Used as C2 Channel for New Golang Malware\nThe alliance’s emergence coincides with the collapse of BreachForums, which has created a vacuum in the underground ecosystem. SLH is attempting to fill that void by recycling notoriety from its constituent groups and formalizing an affiliate-driven extortion model to attract operators displaced by forum disruptions.\nPersonas and Capabilities\nTrustwave’s profile maps key personas shaping the enterprise, including “shinycorp,” viewed as the primary coordinator, and “yuka,” tied to zero-day brokerage and tooling linked historically to advanced malware such as BlackLotus.\nThis verification of skilled exploit development represents a step beyond the unconfirmed ransomware claims highlighted in October.\nOther key personas noted include:\n-\nalg0d (data broker and negotiator)\n-\nUNC-style personas amplifying claims\n-\nSLSHsupport maintaining channel continuity\nConsolidation as Strategy\nIn contrast to earlier speculation that SLH might be posturing or lying low, the group now appears to be building long-term structure.\nTrustwave assessed the effort as the first cohesive alliance inside The Com’s traditionally fluid network, using brand unification as a force multiplier for extortion, recruitment and audience control.\n“As this hybrid ecosystem evolves, its use of identity fluidity, social amplification, growing tailored exploitation development capabilities and adaptive collaboration will likely shape the next phase of data-extortion activity into 2026,” Trustwave warned.\n“Understanding this interplay between performance, persistence, and perception will be essential for anticipating how such threat collectives sustain momentum in an increasingly moderated and intelligence-aware underground landscape.”",
