    "raw": "Microsoft is warning of a scam involving online payroll systems. Criminals use social engineering to steal people&#8217;s credentials, and then divert direct deposits into accounts that they control. Sometimes they do other things to make it harder for the victim to realize what is happening. I feel like this kind of thing is happening everywhere, with everything. As we move more of our personal and professional lives online, we enable criminals to subvert the very systems we rely on.",
