    "raw": "Despite all of their cybersecurity benefits, DNS filters remain one of the most misunderstood tools in most IT pros’ stacks.And to be fair, DNS filters aren’t flashy. They don&#8217;t trigger dramatic security alerts or give you complex attack visualizations to show at the next stakeholder meeting. They just work in the background, quietly keeping all of your users safe.Which is why they’re one of the easiest and most important tools you can deploy for your team or clients. Still not sold? We’re here to debunk all of the misconceptions that prevent organizations from implementing this critical protection. Myth #1: &#8220;We already have firewalls and antivirus, so DNS filtering is redundant.&#8221; Reality: DNS filters stop threats way before other security tools even see them. While firewalls block suspicious connections and antivirus detects malicious files, DNS filtering prevents devices from connecting to dangerous domains in the first place. It complements your existing security tools rather than replaces them. Think of it this way: Your firewall acts like a security guard who stops suspicious visitors at your entrance, and your antivirus works like a security camera that spots threats that make it inside.&nbsp; DNS filtering prevents connections to known malicious websites before they even start — like checking a map and avoiding roads with reported hazards. Not-so-fun fact: According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), more than 91% of malware leverages DNS for attacks. Myth #2: &#8220;DNS filtering will block legitimate websites and disrupt operations.&#8221; Reality: Modern DNS filtering solutions offer precise control over what gets blocked. Period.&nbsp; You decide which categories to filter and which specific sites to allow. Need to block social media but allow LinkedIn for recruiting? No problem. Want to block high-risk categories but allow access to specific trusted websites within them? Easy. The days of blunt, all-or-nothing content filtering belong to the past. Today&#8217;s solutions provide granular controls that prevent disruption while maintaining security. Myth #3: &#8220;Free blocklists provide enough protection.&#8221; Reality: Free, static blocklists quickly become outdated against evolving threats. Hackers create thousands of new malicious domains daily. Free blocklists might catch yesterday&#8217;s threats, but they miss today&#8217;s and tomorrow&#8217;s attacks. Effective DNS protection requires real-time threat intelligence that continuously updates as new dangers emerge. Without this dynamic protection, you’re simply playing catch-up with cybercriminals. Myth #4: &#8220;Users will complain about the restrictions&#8221; Reality: Most users never notice DNS filtering until it saves them from a mistake. When configured properly, DNS filtering operates invisibly. Users access legitimate sites without delay or friction. They only see blocking pages when they attempt to visit dangerous or inappropriate sites. In fact, many organizations find that users appreciate the protection once they understand its purpose. Nobody wants to be responsible for a security breach. Myth #5: &#8220;It&#8217;s another expensive security tool we don&#8217;t need.&#8221; Reality: DNS filtering typically costs waaaaaaaay less than dealing with a single security incident. The average cost of a data breach now exceeds millions of dollars. DNS filtering prevents many common attack vectors for a fraction of a fraction of that cost. Plus, it reduces the operational burden on IT teams by stopping threats before they require incident response. This means fewer after-hours emergencies and less time spent cleaning up compromised systems. The truth about DNS filtering DNS filtering delivers exceptional security value with minimal overhead. It blocks threats at the DNS layer, where the majority of cyberattacks begin. Don&#8217;t let these myths prevent you from implementing this critical security control. The protection DNS filtering provides far outweighs any perceived drawbacks. Our experts are ready to talk all things cybersecurity: From PAM to password management to DNS filtering.
