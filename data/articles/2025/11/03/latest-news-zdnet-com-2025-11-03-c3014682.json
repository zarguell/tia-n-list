I use my desktop for work, paying bills, gaming, and just about everything else. That's why it's so important for me to perform regular maintenance. It keeps my system running smoothly and prevents problems before they happen.\nAlso: Finally, a Windows desktop I can confidently put away my iMac for\nHowever, let's be honest, though: most people don't bother with PC maintenance. It's easy to forget, put off, or avoid out of sheer laziness. I know this because I used to be no different. For the longest time, I never cleaned my computer. I let the dust bunnies populate my tower like a burrow. But over the past few years, I've made it a habit to clean every six months or so. It's well worth the effort because it keeps internal temperatures cool. Heat is the computer killer. Keeping your hardware cool extends its lifespan.\nIt had been a little over six months since the last cleaning at the time of this writing, so I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone and share what I do to maintain my PC's health. These are things that anybody can do. I'll focus on both physical cleaning and basic software maintenance to keep your computer in tip-top condition.\n1. Safety first\nBefore getting started, safety first. Unplug your PC and move it to a part of your home without carpeting, like the garage, a room with hardwood flooring, or tile. This is to minimize the likelihood of static electricity. If you can't move to a non-carpeted space, consider buying either an anti-static wrist strap or an anti-static mat (or both).\nThese aren't strictly necessary. It's very unlikely that static electricity will fry anything in the computer, but it's better to be safe than sorry. Also, flip the power supply switch on the back of your PC to prevent shocks.\nYou'll also need a few basic tools:\n- A can of condensed air - This is a must-have to clear out all the dust. They're cheap, and you can get them at just about any office supply or big-box store like Walmart.\n- Alcohol wipes that are safe for electronics - Similarly, these are relatively cheap and can be bought at big-box stores. You could also use a microfiber cloth with isopropyl alcohol. If you choose the second option, I recommend grabbing a bottle of 91% alcohol and only using a dab. Watered-down solutions leave residue.\n- A small tub of cleaning gel - This is an optional pick that's meant for cleaning your keyboard. It may seem like a strange suggestion, but it's great at getting those hard-to-reach areas.\n2. Cleaning hardware\nFirst, clean up all the dust that's built up inside. To start, remove the side panel of your desktop case. The exact method will vary depending on your model, so it's best to consult your PC's manual. I own a Maingear M1, which only uses a couple of thumbscrews to secure the glass.\nAlso: Everything you need for college: Tech gadgets to make school easier\nOnce the internal components are exposed, grab a can of compressed air and shoot out short bursts of air to blow away the dust. I don't recommend sending out a continuous stream. These air cans get pretty cold and can cause discomfort if held for too long. If any dust gets on the motherboard, use the condensed air to blow it all away.\nDon't use a vacuum cleaner to pick up dust bunnies. The static electricity it generates could damage components. If not the static, the extending hose will when it bumps into parts.\nAfter the inside is clean, wipe the outer surface with the alcohol wipes or the microfiber cloth dampened with 91% isopropyl alcohol. For the monitors, it's not recommended that you clean the glass with alcohol because it \"can harm the screen,\" as pointed out by Lenovo. Instead, just give it a quick once-over with a dry microfiber cloth.\nSome areas, like the spaces in between keyboard caps, are hard to clean. While compressed air can work, it'll often push debris deeper. A better option would be a cleaning gel. It is a reusable blob of goo that picks up crumbs without damaging key switches or getting stuck to anything.\nZDNET Senior Contributing Writer Adrian Kingsley-Hughes recommends the ColorCoral cleaning gel from Amazon. I didn't have that option available. Instead, I bought the Gems Keyboard Cleaning Gel for $5, and it works just as well. Finally, take the time to tidy up any loose hanging cables. Use zip ties to bundle cables neatly to keep them clear of fans and vents.\n3. Sprucing up software\nWhen it comes to software, there are multiple small steps you can take to keep your PC running smoothly:\n- Install Windows updates as soon as they're available to patch up vulnerabilities.\n- Restart your computer regularly to refresh your PC's memory cache.\n- Run antivirus software to remove any malware lingering around.\n- Then there's the tried and true method of uninstalling unused apps to free up PC resources.\nThere is a fifth way: manage your startup programs. Having too many apps launch upon startup can slow down boot times as well as cause CPU and memory usage to spike. Limiting what launches streamlines performance. To do this, open the Task Manager, select the Startup Apps tab as marked by a throttle icon. Right-click on an entry and select Disable. It's quick, easy, and can make a world of difference.\nWhile you're at it, clear out temporary files. There are two main ways to do this: automatically and manually.\n- To automatically delete temporary files, enable Storage Sense, which is found under the Storage section in the Settings menu. The feature will begin freeing up space when disk space runs low.\n- To manually delete temporary files, open Disk Cleanup from the Windows search bar. Select what you want to delete -- like cached data or a clogged-up Recycle Bin. The clutter will be gone in seconds. If you look at the image below, I had about 80GB of junk lying around.\nWhy should you trust me?\nI've been writing about both software and consumer electronics for nearly a decade, and in that time, I've learned firsthand how important regular maintenance is to ensure a computer performs at its best, regardless of whether it's a high-end desktop or midrange model. Working across various environments, from traditional offices to home setups, has shown just how quickly dust builds up and how quickly software gets bogged down.\nSince I spend most of my days on my computer, proper upkeep has become an integral part of my career instead of an afterthought.\nAlso: Why Windows 11 requires a TPM - and how you can get around it\nMy advice shouldn't be taken as hard and fast rules. They're meant to start and help foster the foundation of good PC caretaking. The ultimate goal here is to help you keep your system running as efficiently as possible and extend its lifespan. Keep in mind that the best computer isn't necessarily the newest or most powerful. It's the device that's taken care of the best.",
