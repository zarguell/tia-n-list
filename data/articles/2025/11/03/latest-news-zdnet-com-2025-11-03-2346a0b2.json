OneUI, the software launcher that powers Samsung phones, is best known for its abundance of features -- so much so that you'll either never use some of them because there's simply too much or they're just hidden from plain sight.\nAlso: 5 bloatware apps you should uninstall from your Samsung phone ASAP (without regrets)\nA recent discovery may take the crown for best hidden feature. The feature is called \"Connectivity Labs,\" and it's only accessible with a secret gesture within your phone's Wi-Fi settings. Cool, right?\nThe capabilities within Connectivity Labs are even cooler; they include a home Wi-Fi inspection tool, AI-powered mobile data switching, developer options, and more. Here's how to access them, which Samsung models are compatible, and some of the best features you should start using.\nHow to turn on Connectivity Labs on a Samsung phone\nWhat you'll need: A Samsung phone running OneUI 6 or newer (anything after the Galaxy S20 series).\n1. Opening Intelligent Wi-Fi settings\nYou'll first need to access your Intelligent Wi-Fi settings by opening your Settings app, tapping on the Connections tab, then Wi-Fi, then the three dots (for expanded settings) on the top-right corner, and then Intelligent Wi-Fi.\nAlso: The best Samsung phones to buy in 2025\nThis will present you with a list of adaptive Wi-Fi options.\n2. Turning on Connectivity Labs\nTo activate Connectivity Labs, scroll down to the bottom of the Intelligent Wi-Fi page and tap seven times on the software version (currently labeled as Intelligent Wi-Fi 7.0.0).\nAlso: Changing 10 settings on my Samsung phone gave it a big performance boost\nAs you repeatedly tap, a pop-up message should appear, giving you a countdown for how many more taps are left to activate Connectivity Labs. Once that's done, you'll find the secret menu appear at the bottom of the page.\n3. Navigating Connectivity Labs\nWhen you first open Connectivity Labs, you're presented with a column of graphs depicting the various bands, types, and networks your phone is connected to. There's also a \"Daily Average\" ticker for how long your phone is connected to Wi-Fi every day.\nAlso: The 3 charging mistakes quietly damaging your tablet - and what to do instead\nHowever, the meat of this page is in the bottom half. As you scroll down, you'll find a catalog of useful internet connection toggles, including Wi-Fi 7 mode, Wi-Fi handover, network quality info, and more.\nI've been experimenting with all the options, and while most of them are niche, three are generally useful:\n- Home Wi-Fi inspection: This option runs a live Wi-Fi signal test, showing you drop-offs and spikes in connection strength as you walk around your home. I recently installed new video security cameras around my house and needed an efficient spot to place the monitoring hub. I ran the Wi-Fi inspection tool, found an area in my office with high signal strength, and set it up.\n- Switching to mobile data faster: Have you ever experienced slow internet because you're on the border of a public connection (say, outside a cafe or office building) and your phone is juggling between mobile data and Wi-Fi? Toggling this option will prompt the phone to quickly switch to mobile data when it detects your Wi-Fi signal is weakening. This option is especially great if you're under an unlimited data plan.\n- Wi-Fi Developer Options: This tab contains another list of settings, but one of the most helpful ones is \"Nearby Wi-Fi information,\" which lists the signal strength of your local networks. This can be useful when you have multiple public Wi-Fi networks available -- like at an airport -- and want to know which one will yield the fastest browsing speeds.\nBottom line\nI've only scratched the surface of Connectivity Labs' capabilities, but there are clearly plenty of useful tools within it to make exploring worthwhile. I highly recommend taking the time to investigate these settings, test them out, and discover the options that best cater to your individual internet connectivity needs. You might be surprised at the level of control and optimization you can achieve, all without costing you a penny.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter.",
