When put to great use, it, too, gets cluttered.\nBy continually using your Galaxy Watch, regularly switching between apps and functionalities, or running too many apps at the same time, you're bogging it down with data that clutters it and slows performance. This results in slower performance, frozen screens, and an annoying user experience.\nAlso: I wore the best smartwatches from Samsung, Apple, and Google - here's how Galaxy Watch 8 wins\nLuckily, hope isn't lost -- and you don't need to buy another device to fix this issue. In fact, I'd advise against doing so whenever you're confronting any performance issue with your technology. Before you shell out more money on a new device, there are some tips and tricks you can use to breathe new life into an old one.\nThis brings us to, quite possibly, the easiest fix to lagging smartwatch performance: clearing the cache.\nWhat is cache on a Galaxy Watch?\nThink of a cache like a garbage can. It temporarily stores your smartwatch data (or junk) and, in this half-baked analogy, considers that data when you log into sites or perform regular tasks.\nJust like a garbage can, it gets filled with junk after a while and begins to overflow if not properly handled. You eventually have to dispose of the junk in a dumpster to add more junk (or data) to the can.\nClearing your cache removes some of that junk that's making the garbage can (Galaxy Watch) performance laggy.\nAlso: Why I recommend this Samsung Galaxy Watch over competing Androids\nAccording to a Samsung spokesperson, the Galaxy Watch's memory management operates automatically through system-driven optimization. However, you can still take manual steps to clear the watch's memory.\nHow to clear cache on a Galaxy Watch\n1. Clear your app's cache\nTo close all recent apps on your Galaxy Watch, swipe up from the watch face and tap the Recent apps icon. From there, select Close all.\nIf you want to manage apps running in the background, open the Recent apps screen again and tap Active in background. You can then select the specific app you want to close.\n2. Clean your Galaxy Watch's memory\nTo optimize your phone's performance, go to Settings, select Device Care, and then tap Memory. From there, you can choose Clean Now to free up space.\nFAQs\nHow often should I clear my cache?\nIt's best practice to occasionally clear your Galaxy Watch's cache, especially if you notice performance slowdowns or hiccups. The process is straightforward and quick, but it should make a noticeable difference in how your watch performs afterward.\nWhen shouldn't I clear my cache?\nIf your watch is buggy, laggy, or draining battery faster than normal, clearing the cache can remove corrupted or outdated files, one Reddit user explains. The Reddit user also explains that there are certain circumstances when you should avoid cache-clearing, like right after a software update, when the smartwatch is already using extra compute power to rebuild the cache.\nAlso: How to clear your Android phone cache (and why it makes such a big difference)\nCould restarting my watch do the same thing?\nRestarting your watch could remove some bugs and glitches. However, a reboot won't clear the cache, so no, it isn't the same thing.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter.",
