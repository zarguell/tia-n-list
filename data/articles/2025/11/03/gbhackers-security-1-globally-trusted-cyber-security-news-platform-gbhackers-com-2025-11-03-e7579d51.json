    "full": "A Ukrainian national accused of participating in one of the most damaging ransomware campaigns in history has been extradited from Ireland to face charges in the United States.\nOleksii Oleksiyovych Lytvynenko, 43, appeared in federal court in Tennessee following his transfer from Irish custody, where he had been held since his arrest in July 2023.\nGlobal Ransomware Campaign Targeted Over 1,000 Victims\nAccording to federal prosecutors, Lytvynenko conspired with others to deploy Conti ransomware against victims worldwide between 2020 and June 2022.\nThe operation attacked more than 1,000 victims across approximately 47 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 31 foreign countries.\nCourt documents allege that the conspirators infiltrated computer networks, encrypted victim data, and demanded ransom payments to restore access while threatening to publicly release stolen information.\nThe FBI estimates that Conti ransomware attacks generated at least $150 million in ransom payments by January 2022.\nThe malware particularly targeted critical infrastructure, with 2021 data showing Conti was used against more critical infrastructure victims than any other ransomware variant that year.\nIn Tennessee alone, the conspirators allegedly extorted over $500,000 in cryptocurrency from two victims and published stolen data from a third.\nIrish national police, An Garda Síochána, arrested Lytvynenko in July 2023 at the request of U.S. authorities.\nCourt filings allege that Lytvynenko controlled data stolen from numerous Conti victims and played a direct role in creating ransom notes deployed on compromised systems.\nProsecutors claim he remained active in cybercrime activities until just days before his arrest in Ireland.\nFollowing extended extradition proceedings, Lytvynenko was transferred to U.S. custody this month. He now faces charges of computer fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy.\nIf convicted, he could receive a maximum sentence of five years for computer fraud conspiracy and 20 years for wire fraud conspiracy.\nThe case represents part of a broader effort to dismantle the Conti ransomware network. In September 2023, federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment charging four other Conti conspirators in Tennessee.\nThe investigation involves multiple FBI field offices in Nashville, San Diego, and El Paso, along with the U.S. Secret Service.\nJustice Department officials emphasized their commitment to pursuing ransomware operators globally.\nThe department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section has secured convictions of over 180 cybercriminals since 2020 and obtained court orders returning more than $350 million to victims.\nAuthorities continue urging organizations to report ransomware incidents promptly to local FBI offices.\nFollow us on Google News, LinkedIn, and X to Get Instant Updates and Set GBH as a Preferred Source in Google.",
