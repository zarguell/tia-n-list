We gather data from the best available sources, including vendor and retailer listings as well as other relevant and independent reviews sites.

Indeed, we follow strict guidelines that ensure our editorial content is never influenced by advertisers.\nZDNET's editorial team writes on behalf of you, our reader.

Not everyone can use a trackpad effectively, and being trapped by your laptop's small display can hamper productivity. Luckily, there are some great accessories that can make using a laptop a whole lot better.\nAlso: The top 10 laptops our readers bought this year so far (no. 1 surprised us)\nIf you're finding yourself running out of ports, you should check out a dock or USB hub. If you're always low on battery, it'd be worth it to invest in a battery pack. If you find yourself squinting at the small display, you might want a portable monitor.\nWe've personally gone hands-on with everything on this list, so to help you cut through all the noise, I narrowed things down to five accessory categories with multiple recommendations. Any one of these devices will let you get the most out of your machine.\nMy favorite portable monitors\nMulti-screen setups aren't limited to desktops. Portable monitors let you take that unique layout on the go. While they can't match the immersion of a 4K gaming display, these smaller screens are perfect for travelers, professionals, or students who want a second screen.\nEven better, portable monitors these days are just one-click to set up, drawing power from the laptop and not requiring any additional software or hookups.\nThis 15.6-inch portable monitor from Plugable is around $240 on Amazon and a great affordable option. We noted the monitor's portability in particular -- easily slipping into a bag alongside your laptop.\nOne of my favorites is the Uperfect True 4K Portable Monitor, a slim 15.6-inch display that measures just 0.5 inches thick. Purchasing from Amazon will also net you a free smart case that doubles as both protection and a viewing stand. The price is competitive, falling in between higher-end options and budget models.\nIf your budget is higher and you want to stick to a tried-and-true brand, my high-end suggestion is the ViewSonic VX1655 -- it has a 4K OLED display housing a pair of speakers and a built-in stand, and ViewSonic has been making high-quality displays for decades. Customer reviews on Amazon praise the device for its high-quality visual output, even putting it above the display on the MacBook Pro.\nMy top-rated external storage drives\nA common frustration I have when laptop shopping is being forced into costly upgrades just to get the storage size I want. For example, the Dell 16 Plus with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor comes with a 1TB SSD. If I wanted a 2TB SSD, I'd have to move up to the Ultra 9 model, increasing the price by $350.\nAlso: The best external hard drives you can buy right now\nInstead, you can invest in an external SSD, which is far cheaper than buying a forced upgrade (and way more flexible). ZDNET's top-rated drive is the Lexar SL500. The base option offers 1TB of storage with lightning-fast 2,000 Mb/s read and 1,800 MB/s write speeds, and it's about the size of a credit card, so it easily fits inside your pocket.\nFor a more durable option, I recommend the WD My Passport Ultra. It is cheaper, but can also take a beating, with a sturdy metal enclosure and a 256-bit AES encryption for added security. It also comes with WD Backup, which simplifies (and optimizes) the data backup process.\nIf you're looking for an SSD with top-tier security, one of the most secure on the market is the iStorage DiskAshur Pro 3. It's one of our top picks for its AES-XTS 256-bit hardware encryption, meaning all data on the drive is always encrypted -- unlike drives that rely on software encryption. Additionally, it's certified to the FIPS 140-3 Level 3 standard, with an alphanumeric keypad for entering an 8-to-64-character passcode.\nMy favorite power banks\nI'll be honest: I don't like carrying around laptop chargers. They take up too much space in my bag (even the slim ones), and you have to hope there's a free outlet wherever you go. A better option is investing in a power bank.\nThe two most important features in a laptop-ready power bank are battery capacity and wattage. Aim for one with a 20,000mAh battery, so the device can actually recharge the computer. For wattage, buy one that delivers up to 100W for fast charging. 30W power banks technically work, but they'll take forever to recharge a laptop, and if you're using it, it may not recharge at all.\nAlso: The best power banks you can buy in 2025\nA great choice is the Ugreen Nexode 2,000mAh 130W. It's powerful enough to charge multiple devices at once with 20,000mAh and three ports. However, it's one of the more chunky chargers, weighing about a pound. It's currently around $70 on Amazon.\nA more premium option is the Cuktech P-Series, with a massive 25,000mAh battery and maximum output of 210W. It's one of our favorites for its stylish design with advanced technology on board that pushes the envelope of what a power bank can achieve. The device's well-lit display shows all the information you could want, such as battery level, power, and voltage. A tap of the button brings up a graphical display of the input and output wattages.\nMy top-rated docks\nLaptops have certainly gotten more lightweight, but one of the trade-offs is the limited port selection. The M4 MacBook Air, for example, only has Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack -- hardly enough for a busy professional who needs to connect flash drives, monitors, and charge all at once. That's where USB hubs come in to save the day, hooking you up with all the extra ports for your gear.\nAlso: The best laptop docking stations you can buy\nOne of my favorites is the EZQuest 6-in-1 USB-C Slim Hub Adapter. It is a pocket-sized hub, weighing just three ounces, but offers six USB-C ports. Four of these provide data transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps. The fifth delivers 4K video signals at 60Hz, and the sixth supports 100W power delivery. Its removable cable enables better portability when needed, and the aluminum chassis makes it notably tough. All of that is to say that this is probably the only dock you'll ever need.\nIf you need a more robust option, I'm a big fan of the Belkin Connect 11-in-1 Universal USB-C Pro Dock. It supports HDMI video output, wired internet connections via Ethernet, and houses a couple of SD card slots alongside a few Thunderbolt ports.\nMy favorite lightweight laptop mice\nA laptop's trackpad is fine for casual browsing; but a proper mouse offers better precision, speed, and comfort -- three qualities crucial for long work days. Speaking from personal experience, there's nothing quite like a mouse that minimizes hand strain. Your body will thank you.\nAlso: The best silent mouse you can buy\nFor a budget-friendly mouse, check out the HP 280. It is a silent computer mouse we praised for its long battery life and ergonomic design. It's compact size makes it easy to throw into your bag, and it's very power efficient, lasting up to 18 months on the same pair of batteries. Not bad for a $22 mouse.\nIf you want something more premium, I suggest the Logitech MX Anywhere 3 for its lightweight design and 70-hour battery life. Logitech is respected brand in this area, producing ergonomic and accessible devices that will last. The Anywhere 3 is an all-around comfortable, durable device that comes in four colors.\nIf portability is your primary concern, check out Logitech's Pebble Mouse 2 M350s. The aptly-named mouse sports a sleek, flat design that's ideal for small spaces like the coffee shop or a cramped co-working environment. Despite its small size, it's expressly comfortable and easy to use, with a 24-month battery.\nWhy should you trust me?\nI've been writing about both software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years now. And in that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office, and even someone's backyard. My experience has made me extremely selective about how I support and enhance my laptops. I want to make sure that the accessories I choose improve my experience in some way.\nAlso: The fastest laptops you can buy\nI'm at a point in my career where I've practically tried out every type of laptop accessory on the market, from computer mice to docking stations and power banks. I know which features and specs people should look out for when shopping for a new accessory -- and which ones are not worth their time.\nMy advice is not a set of hard and fast rules that you absolutely have to adhere to. I just want to give you a good idea of what you should look for. What is best for you depends on your unique needs.",
