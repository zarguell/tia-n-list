What do you choose? If you've started shopping, you likely already noticed an overwhelming amount of options. Some promise dazzling color with HDR, others emphasize high refresh rates, and then there are the ultra-wide curved screens.\nAlso: How to buy the right laptop during the holiday season (and common mistakes to avoid)\nIt can be information overload. Fortunately, I'm here to help out. This guide will break down the main factors to consider, rounded out with a few recommendations to point you in the right direction, including my current favorite monitor.\nThe three most important factors to consider are:\n- Size/resolution\n- Panel type\n- Refresh rate\nLet's break them down.\n1. Size and resolution\nI consider a monitor's size to be its most crucial aspect, as it sets the stage for every other feature. A big screen gives you lots of room, making tasks like video editing significantly easier. But bigger isn't always better, as large displays take up a lot of room. For example, the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is a massive 57-inch ultrawide that looks incredible, but its sheer size makes it impractical for a small home office.\nMonitors come in a variety of dimensions, but standard sizes start at 24 inches, then go up to 27 inches, then 32 inches. Once you go above 32 inches you'll start seeing significant price increases.\nAlso: The best all-in-one computers of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nResolution is measured in PPI, or pixels per inch. PPI measures the density of individual pixels on a display and how sharp and detailed an image appears. The more pixels condensed, the more detailed the on-screen image.\nI recommend 27-inch monitors with a resolution of 1440p. These specs are a \"Goldilocks\" standard -- not too big, not too small, while still delivering crisp visuals at an affordable price. Higher resolutions will bring the price up, while lower resolutions are cheaper.\nOne of my personal favorites I use every day is this Acer Nitro 27-inch. I bought it primarily for its lightning-fast 180Hz refresh rate and 0.5ms response time, ideal specs for gaming. Right now, it's on sale for $189 at Best Buy.\n2. Panel type\nPanel type refers to the display technology creating the visual output. While there are many options, I'll focus on three of the most common.\nVA, or vertical alignment monitors are known for high contrast ratios, producing vivid colors and deep blacks. Some models, like the Koorui E2412F have a contrast ratio of 3,000:1. However, they're also among the cheapest displays on the market, with some models prone to blurring.\nAlso: Finally, a big screen all-in-one PC that business users and creatives will both appreciate\nIPS, or in-plane switching, monitors are the go-to choice for professionals and gamers because of their excellent color accuracy, wide viewing angles, and fast refresh rates. Most laptops and monitors we review have IPS panels. The Acer Nitro 27 mentioned above is one of these monitors. The downside to IPS screens is lower contrast ratios and less vivid colors than OLEDs.\nOLED, or organic light-emitting diode, monitors are the cream of the crop, delivering superior visual fidelity. They boast rich colors, wide viewing angles, deep contrast, and fast response times. Because OLEDs are the best, they're also the most expensive; however, the technology has gotten so good that there are affordable options out there.\nA gorgeous OLED monitor I recommend is the Alienware 34 QD-OLED. If I had the room, I'd own this monitor in a heartbeat. It's a large, ultrawide screen that runs at Wide Quad HD resolution (3,440 x 1,440 pixels) and a refresh rate of 240Hz. The visual output is nothing short of incredible. Plus, the large size provides a ton of workspace.\nReview: Alienware 34 240Hz QD-OLED Gaming Monitor\nAt $799, it's not cheap, but it's a solid investment from a brand that's been in the business for decades. For gamers and creatives, this is the 34-inch monitor I recommend most. Check out my full-length review for my experience testing it.\n3. Refresh rate\nFinally, refresh rate refers to how often a monitor updates the images on screen, measured in hertz (Hz). For the casual user, 60Hz is perfectly fine. Power users, creators, and gamers, however, will want a higher refresh rate like 90Hz, 120Hz, or 240Hz. Just keep in mind that those numbers will put you into premium pricing territory.\nApple's Studio Display is a fantastic high-end option for Mac users, particularly creatives working with high-fidelity video, photo editing, animation, and design applications.\nReview: Apple Studio Display\nThe Apple Studio Display sports a 27-inch, 5K resolution panel, churning out high-quality visuals. Its image quality, combined with its six-speaker system, makes it arguably perfect for professionals on Mac.\nThis affordable 27-inch monitor from KTC offers a smooth 120Hz refresh rate for a variety of use cases. It's an IPS panel with a handful of different resolution options, but the QHD configuration is a solid pick for most people.\n4. Additional recommendations\nOutside of these three main points, also consider ergonomics. A good ergonomic monitor will have an adjustable hinge, allowing you to pivot, tilt, raise, or lower a screen to improve comfort.\nAlso: What the colors of your USB ports tell you (and why some are more capable than others)\nThere are also smart displays, which are something like a mix between a smart TV and a monitor. They come with their own remotes and can be standalone displays for streaming services and other apps, while also connecting to your computer.\nWhy should you trust me?\nI've been writing about both software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years now, and in that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office, and even someone's backyard. The remote experience has made me extremely selective about what I choose to be my main monitors as I want to ensure the panels I use can handle my day-to-day tasks. I'm on my computer all day, practically every day of the week.\nAlso: I tested several AIO computers in 2025, and these are the best for your office setup\nI'm at a point where I know exactly what features and specs to look out for. I know what makes a monitor a must-have and what makes a monitor a must-pass. The advice I have given is not a set of hard and fast rules. I just aim to provide a foundation of what you should look for in a computer monitor. What is best for you depends on your unique needs.",
