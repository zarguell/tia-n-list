Conduent January 2025 breach exposed the personal data of over 10M people, including names, addresses, DOBs, SSNs, and health and insurance info.

Conduent reported no major operational impact from the cyberattack but did face significant one-time costs for notifications. The company holds cyber insurance and informed federal authorities. Conduent disclosed that hackers accessed its network from October 21, 2024, to January 13, 2025, stealing personal data of users, including SSNs, DOBs, addresses, and health info.
