In February, XWiki released an advisory (and patch) for an arbitrary remote code execution vulnerability. Affected was the SolrSearch component, which any user, even with minimal &quot;Guest&quot; privileges, can use. The advisory included PoC code, so it is a bit odd that it took so long for the vulnerability to be widely exploited.",
