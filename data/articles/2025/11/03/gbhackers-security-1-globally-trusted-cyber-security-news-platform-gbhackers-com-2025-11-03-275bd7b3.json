    "full": "OpenAI has announced the launch of Aardvark, an autonomous AI security agent powered by GPT-5 that aims to revolutionize how organizations discover and fix software vulnerabilities.\nThe new tool, currently available in private beta, represents a significant advancement in automated security research and threatens to shift the balance of power in favor of cyber defenders.\nAutomated Vulnerability Discovery at Scale\nAardvark operates as an autonomous security researcher that continuously monitors source code repositories to identify vulnerabilities, assess their exploitability, and propose targeted patches.\nUnlike traditional security tools that rely on fuzzing or software composition analysis, Aardvark uses large language model-powered reasoning to understand code behavior the same way human security researchers do by reading code, analyzing it, writing tests, and using various tools to identify potential security flaws.\nThe system follows a multi-stage pipeline that begins with analyzing the full repository to create a threat model reflecting the project’s security objectives.\nIt then scans commits for vulnerabilities by inspecting changes against the entire codebase and threat model.\nWhen potential vulnerabilities are discovered, Aardvark attempts to exploit them in isolated sandbox environments to confirm they represent genuine security risks rather than false positives.\nFinally, it integrates with OpenAI Codex to generate patches that developers can review and apply with one click.\nAardvark has been running across OpenAI’s internal codebases and external alpha partner systems for several months, surfacing meaningful vulnerabilities and strengthening defensive security postures.\nIn benchmark testing on repositories containing known vulnerabilities, the system achieved an impressive 92 percent detection rate, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.\nThe tool has also made significant contributions to open-source security. OpenAI has responsibly disclosed numerous vulnerabilities discovered by Aardvark in open-source projects, with ten already receiving Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identifiers.\nThe company plans to offer pro-bono scanning to select non-commercial open-source repositories to strengthen the broader software supply chain.\nWith over 40,000 CVEs reported in 2024 alone and approximately 1.2 percent of code commits introducing bugs, software vulnerabilities represent a systemic risk to businesses and critical infrastructure worldwide.\nAardvark’s continuous monitoring approach catches vulnerabilities early in the development cycle, validates real-world exploitability, and provides clear fixes without slowing down innovation.\nOpenAI has updated its coordinated disclosure policy to take a developer-friendly approach focused on collaboration rather than rigid timelines that can pressure maintainers.\nAs the company broadens availability beyond the current private beta, Aardvark could democratize access to advanced security expertise and help organizations strengthen their security posture against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.\nFollow us on Google News, LinkedIn, and X to Get Instant Updates and Set GBH as a Preferred Source in Google.",
