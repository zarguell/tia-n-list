There are USB-C and USB-A output ports and corresponding USB-C, Lightning, miniUSB, and microUSB 2.0 and microUSB 3.0 input ports to testing cables. This means the tester can accommodate any cable with the respective output and input port.\nThe unit is powered by a single AAA battery, or alternatively you can use USB-C input.
