    "full": "Security researcher TwoSevenOneT has released EDR-Redir V2, an upgraded evasion tool that exploits Windows bind link technology to bypass endpoint detection and response solutions on Windows 11.\nThe new version demonstrates a sophisticated approach to redirecting security software by manipulating parent directories rather than directly targeting protected EDR folders.\nNovel Attack Methodology Targets Parent Folders\nUnlike the original EDR-Redir tool that created bind links directly to antivirus and EDR executable folders, version 2 employs a different strategy targeting parent directories such as Program Files or ProgramData.\nThe researcher discovered that while EDR solutions protect their operating folders from unauthorized file writing, they cannot prevent modifications to parent directories without disrupting legitimate software installations across the system.\nThe technique creates a circular bind link structure where folders point back to themselves through an attacker-controlled temporary directory.\nEDR-Redir V2 first queries all subfolders within the target parent directory, then creates corresponding folders in an attacker-controlled location like C:\\TMP\\TEMPDIR.\nThe tool establishes bind links creating a loop that causes folder access to circle back through the temporary directory, deliberately excluding the EDR’s specific folder from this loop.\nIn a proof-of-concept demonstration, the researcher successfully redirected Windows Defender on Windows 11. Windows Defender operates from C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender, making the ProgramData\\Microsoft folder the attack target.\nRunning EDR-Redir with specific parameters successfully forced Windows Defender to perceive the attacker-controlled temporary directory as its parent folder, enabling potential DLL hijacking attacks.\nThe tool execution requires three parameters: the folder to redirect, the target location, and the exception folder that should remain unlinked.\nDuring execution, EDR-Redir displays console information about created bind links for monitoring purposes, confirming successful redirection of the security software.\nThe researcher suggests this technique could affect numerous antivirus and EDR solutions, as many developers may not anticipate parent directories like Program Files being redirected during normal operations.\nOnce an attacker successfully compromises the parent folder, EDR protection of operating directories becomes ineffective.\nThe technique opens pathways for DLL hijacking by allowing attackers to drop malicious executable files into the redirected temporary directory.\nSecurity teams can defend against this attack vector by implementing monitoring for bind link creation attempts targeting critical system folders like Program Files and ProgramData.\nThe tool is publicly available on GitHub, raising concerns about potential exploitation by threat actors targeting enterprise environments.\nOrganizations running Windows 11 with various EDR solutions should evaluate their vulnerability to parent folder redirection techniques and implement appropriate bind link monitoring controls.\nFollow us on Google News, LinkedIn, and X to Get Instant Updates and Set GBH as a Preferred Source in Google.",
