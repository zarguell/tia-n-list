    "full": "The CrowdStrike Falcon® platform has once again proven its leadership in endpoint protection. In SE Labs’ September 2025 Enterprise Endpoint Security (EPS) evaluation, the Falcon platform earned the AAA EPS certification and achieved 100% Protection Accuracy, 100% Legitimate Accuracy, and 100% Total Accuracy, with zero false positives.\nIn addition to the EPS certification, CrowdStrike was named the winner in three categories at this summer’s 2025 SE Labs Security Awards ceremony. The Falcon platform received awards for Enterprise Endpoint (Windows) and Enterprise Ransomware, while CrowdStrike Falcon® Go collected the 2025 SE Labs Award for Small Business New Endpoint.\nThis series of wins — recognition from a trusted, independent authority in cybersecurity testing — showcases the industry-leading effectiveness of the Falcon platform’s unified, cloud-native architecture and CrowdStrike’s continuous AI innovation.\nHow the Falcon Platform was Evaluated\nTo conduct its EPS test, SE Labs exposed security solutions to a combination of 75 targeted attacks and 25 general attacks. Solutions were scored based on the below criteria:\nProtection Score: The Falcon platform detected and then blocked or neutralized all 75 general attacks and 25 targeted attacks. This earned a 100% Protection score, with a 100% in Protection Accuracy.\nFalse Positives: The Falcon platform scored 100% in Legitimate Accuracy, with zero false positives. The misclassification of a legitimate application, website, or process as being malicious wastes SOC analysts’ time and inconveniences users.\nTotal Accuracy: SE Labs combined each tested product’s scores for detecting and protecting against threats with its ability to handle legitimate applications and processes for a Total Accuracy score. The Falcon platform earned 100%.\nThe full attack chain included attempted reconnaissance, data exfiltration, and system damage. None of the attacks progressed far in the killchain when deployed against the Falcon platform: 100% were detected and either blocked or neutralized before they could progress.\nSE Labs exposed security solutions to a mix of targeted attacks using well-established techniques, and public email and web-based threats occurring online at the time of the test. The SE Labs team employed “public malware and full-on hacking attacks” using publicly available tools to recreate realistic attack scenarios that enterprise systems face on a daily basis. The results of the test indicate a solution’s effectiveness at detecting and/or protecting against those threats in real time.\nFor full details about SE Labs testing methodology, the September 2025 EPS test report is available here.\nFalcon Go Awarded for Small Business New Endpoint\nCrowdStrike Falcon® Go was awarded SE Labs’ Small Business New Endpoint award, which celebrates emerging endpoint solutions that have shown exceptional early promise in protecting small businesses. This recognition demonstrates CrowdStrike’s innovation, usability, and effectiveness in stopping threats for large and small organizations alike.\nThe stakes are high for small businesses. Limited budgets for defense and small (or non-existent) in-house security teams make small businesses a big target for adversaries. While large organizations often have resources to survive the fallout from a cyberattack, a small business may never recover. It’s critical they have an affordable and effective cybersecurity solution.\nFalcon Go delivers AI-powered protection, an easy-to-manage interface, and pre-configured deployment, bringing the advanced protection of the AI-native Falcon platform to businesses of all sizes.\nCrowdStrike Only Winner in Enterprise Ransomware Defense\nThe Falcon platform achieved a perfect score in the SE Labs ransomware test, delivering a 100% Detection Accuracy rating, 100% Protection rating, 100% Legitimate Software rating, and 100% Total Accuracy rating. CrowdStrike is the only vendor to have received this award.\nEarlier this year, in testing against ransomware attacks, SE Labs employed realistic scenarios using tactics and techniques observed in the wild, including full attack chains and both deep and direct attacks. In deep attacks, protection was disabled to assess the product’s ability to track attackers through every stage, from accessing targets using stolen credentials or other means, through system compromise and ransomware deployment. Direct attacks measure a product’s ability to detect and protect against a wide range of both known ransomware payloads and previously unknown variants.\n“CrowdStrike Falcon performed exceptionally well, providing complete detection and protection against all direct ransomware attacks,” SE Labs said. “It also provided thorough insight into the full network breaches that concluded with ransomware deployments. There were no false positive results. An excellent result in an extremely challenging test.”\nTo learn more about CrowdStrike Falcon’s performance in SE Labs’ Enterprise Ransomware test, read the full report.\nFalcon Platform Wins Enterprise Endpoint Award (Windows)\nThe Falcon platform was recognized as the most effective and reliable endpoint protection solution for enterprise environments running Microsoft Windows. It demonstrated superior threat detection, operational stability, and resilience against targeted attacks, verified through SE Labs’ independent testing framework.\nSE Labs conducted a series of full chain attacks, using real-world adversary tactics and techniques to test a product’s ability to detect and protect against attackers, while recognizing the use of legitimate software to reduce time-wasting false positives. The Falcon platform was recognized with the 2025 SE Labs award for Enterprise Endpoint (Windows) for its ability to detect attacks and stop breaches.\nRead the full details on the CrowdStrike Falcon’s performance in SE Labs’ Enterprise Endpoint (Windows) report.\nIndependent Testing Confirms CrowdStrike’s Industry Leadership\nCrowdStrike recognizes that independent third-party testing organizations such as SE Labs are essential to the cybersecurity industry. The evaluations they conduct and publish provide authoritative, unbiased validation of product performance and give customers verified data to evaluate cybersecurity solutions. The feedback from testing helps drive continuous improvement across the industry at a time when adversaries are constantly innovating.\nWe are proud to accept these awards from SE Labs as validation that CrowdStrike’s focus on innovation ensures the Falcon platform delivers on its mission to stop breaches.\nAdditional Resources\n- In July 2025, CrowdStrike was named a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Endpoint Protection Platforms for the sixth consecutive time.
