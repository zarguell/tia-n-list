I don't mean using your fingernail to pick out wax buildup in your earbuds' eartips, but actually cleaning them? Cleaning your headphones and earbuds can help keep your ears and your devices in optimal condition.\nIf you're like me, the inside of your AirPods case is a private matter. Aside from picking out the wax, they need a good cleaning, especially in between sweaty workout sessions. A dirt-filled earbud not only ruins the listening experience but may also cause long-term damage to the internal components. Let's avoid that.\nAlso: These $15 accessories turned my AirPods into the most versatile earbuds I've worn\nIt's a simple process, and, contrary to popular belief, you don't actually need dedicated tools to clean them thoroughly; you can use what you already have at home. If it's been a while since you gave your earbuds or headphones some TLC, here are some tips to follow for their next wash.\nHow to clean your earbuds\nWhat you'll need: Your earbuds, mild soap and warm water, a microfiber cloth, a soft-bristle toothbrush, or cotton swab, and a dry paper towel.\n1. Only clean hard plastics, silicone; avoid sensors\nFirst, remove your earbuds from their charging case and set them to the side. Then fill a cup of water and add a few drops of mild soap or micellar water, mixing well. Wet your toothbrush, microfiber cloth, or cotton swab and wipe or scrub the earbuds' mesh coverings, hard plastic, and silicone ear tips.\nTo remove any excess cleaning solution, rinse your cleaning tool and repeat the cleaning process. Then, dab your earbuds on a paper towel, and leave them to dry before returning them to the charging case.\nAlso: I wore the best headphones from Sony, Bose, Apple, and Sonos: Here's how the AirPods Max wins\nBe sure to check your earbuds' IP rating before putting them in contact with water. Most earbuds these days have an IPX4 or IP54 rating, and the \"4\" indicates that the earbuds can handle splashes of water. Despite their water ingress rating, avoid submerging them in water or running water over them.\n2. Clean the charging case\nWith your earbuds out of the charging case, inspect the bottom for any visible loose debris. To remove wax, dirt, or dust inside the case, use a dry soft-bristle toothbrush or a cotton swab. You can dampen your cleaning tool to clean the inside carefully, avoiding damaging the metal charging connectors inside the case.\nEnsure the case is dry before reinserting your earbuds.\nHow to clean your over-ear headphones\nWhat you'll need: Your headphones, mild soap and warm water, and a microfiber cloth, soft bristle toothbrush, or paper towel.\n1. Remove the ear pads (if possible)\nSome headphones have magnetic ear pads for easy removal, but others require more force. If you're concerned about damaging your ear pads by pulling them off, you can keep them on, but avoid getting liquid inside the earcups.\n2. Only clean hard plastics and soft leathers\nDampen your cleaning tool with your mild soap and water solution. Unlike earbuds, most over-ear headphones are not formally tested for water ingress. To prevent damage to the internal audio components, avoid getting the inside of the earcups wet.\nAlso: Why these headphones are still the best from Bose - even though they're a year old\nUse your damp cleaning tool to thoroughly wipe the ear pads and headband. If you removed your ear pads, let them dry before reattaching them. If your ear pads are still on, let them dry before wearing your headphones.\nFAQs\nWhy should I clean my headphones and earbuds?\nYour ears are self-cleaning organs and orifices, or natural openings on your body. It's essential to keep your ears and earbuds, headphones, and hearing aids clean to avoid introducing dirt and harmful bacteria into them.\nAccording to Lachelle Lazarus, AuD, Audiologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center, regularly inserting earbuds into your ears doesn't pose an inherent risk. Still, keeping them clean is a good idea, especially if you use them daily.\nAlso: I replaced my Bose UltraComfort headphones for the Sony XM6 - here's how it went\n\"We do advise patients to keep earbuds [and] hearing aids clean to prevent any bacterial growth on the device that they would be re-inserting in their ear. Extensive use throughout the day does not pose a significant health risk, but we would recommend wiping the earbuds daily,\" she says.\nIn-canal earbuds that go inside your ear canal can encourage warm, moist conditions in your ear that can encourage harmful bacteria growth and lead to irritation. Reinserting old wax can clog the ear, trapping moisture and causing an issue.\nUnlike earbuds, over-ear headphones do not contact the inside of your ear. However, shampoo, sunscreen, sweat, and natural skin oils can build up on the ear pads and irritate the skin around your ears, so it's recommended that you clean them from time to time.\nAlso: Unplugging these 7 common household devices greatly reduced my electricity bill\nAccording to J. Ryan Smolarz, MD, MBA, Otolaryngology Specialist, some headphones and earbuds are made from materials that can irritate your ears and the skin around them. He also acknowledges that your earbuds and headphones constantly touch your bags, pockets, your dirty hands, and other surfaces that expose them to germs.\nAs important as it is to clean your earbuds and your ears from debris, it's important to give your ears a break.",
