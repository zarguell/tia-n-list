    "raw": "Ukrainian Oleksii Lytvynenko extradited from Ireland to US for alleged role in Conti ransomware after fleeing Ukraine in 2022. Ukrainian national Oleksii Lytvynenko (43) extradited from Ireland to the US, faces charges for alleged involvement in Conti ransomware attacks after fleeing Ukraine in 2022. The man appeared in a US court and was charged with deploying Conti ransomware that extorted over $500K from US victims. &#8220;According to court documents, from in or around 2020 and continuing until about June 2022, Oleksii Oleksiyovych Lytvynenko, 43, of Cork, Ireland, conspired with others to deploy Conti ransomware to extort victims and steal their data.&#8221; reads the press release published by DoJ. &#8220;Court filings allege the conspirators hacked into victims’ computer networks, encrypted their data, and demanded a ransom to restore the victims’ access to their files and avoid public disclosure of the hacked information.&#8221; Court filings allege Lytvynenko managed stolen Conti victim data and ransom notes. The Ukrainian national was arrested in Ireland in 2023 and continued cybercrime until his capture. “The defendant allegedly participated in a conspiracy to extort approximately $150 million in ransomware payments responsible for defrauding victims in almost every U.S. state and from over two dozen countries worldwide,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Ransomware is a significant threat to the safety, security, and prosperity of American citizens and business. The Department will continue to pursue ransomware actors all over the world in its efforts to hold them to account for the damage they have inflicted on victims.” FBI’s Brett Leatherman added that Lytvynenko conspired to deploy Conti ransomware globally, extorting millions in crypto. His extradition highlights US–Ireland cooperation. The man faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of computer and wire fraud conspiracy. The FBI urges organizations to stay vigilant and promptly report ransomware incidents. In September 2023, four other Conti conspirators were indicted in Tennessee. The FBI and U.S. Secret Service are investigating, with DOJ prosecutors handling the case.
