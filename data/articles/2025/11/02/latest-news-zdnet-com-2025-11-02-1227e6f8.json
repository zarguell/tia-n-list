These headphones offer way more features when connected to an Apple device than when connected to other devices.\nBut Apple isn't the only one to take advantage of its multi-device ecosystem. Samsung does it too, with its Galaxy Buds 3 Pro earbuds heading its audio lineup.\nAlso: The Nothing Ear 3 have a clever feature I wish my other earbuds had - and they're less than $180\nBut has one company done a better job building out its feature set? Are one pair of earbuds actually better than the other, or does it just depend on the ecosystem of devices you choose to use? I've used both the AirPods Pro 3 and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro pretty extensively, and here's my take.\nSpecifications\nApple AirPods Pro 3 | Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro | |\nBattery life | 8 hours (up to 24 hours with charging case) | 6 hours (up to 20 hours with charging case) |\nAudio modes | ANC, Transparency Mode, Adaptive Audio | ANC, Ambient Sound, Adaptive |\nIP rating | IP57 (earbuds only) | IP57 (earbuds only) |\nBluetooth version | Bluetooth 5.3 | Bluetooth 5.4 |\nAdditional features | Hearing aid mode, live translation, Automatic Switching, Spatial Audio, heart rate monitor | Hearing enhancements, Interpreter, Auto switch, 360 audio |\nPrice |\nYou should buy the AirPods Pro 3 if...\n1. You're currently an Apple user\nThis one's obvious -- the AirPods Pro 3 work best with Apple products. Technically, you can pair the AirPods Pro 3 via Bluetooth to non-Apple devices, but you'll have a pretty limited experience and won't be able to use advanced features like spatial audio, Find My, and automatic wearing detection.\nAlso: How to use Live Translation on your AirPods - not just the newest ones\nWith Apple products, you can use automatic switching to seamlessly connect to an infinite number of compatible devices logged in to your iCloud account. You can also use spatial audio for a more immersive listening experience (I personally only really use it for movies and TV shows). And, you'll get access to the new Live Translation feature, which can translate speech in other languages in real-time when the AirPods in your ears are connected to an iPhone.\n2. You want fitness tracking features\nThe AirPods Pro 3's standout feature is the inclusion of an in-ear heart rate monitor. This feature shifts the AirPods Pro from an audio-only device to a combination of an audio device and a health tracker. The heart rate monitor can be used for over 50 different workout types, which you can access straight through the Apple Fitness app.\nAlso: AirPods Pro 3 fitness feature surprises triathlete tester - here's what he found\nThe AirPods Pro 3 also work with the new Workout Buddy feature, which analyzes your fitness data using AI, then provides personalized motivation while you work out, in audio form, through your earbuds. That helps bridge the gap between health trackers and actual trainers.\n3. You want better battery life\nThe Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro offer a solid battery life, promising six hours of continuous listening with ANC enabled, and a total of 20 hours with the charging case. The AirPods Pro 3, however, beat that. The earbuds offer eight hours of continuous listening, which makes them a better option for a long-haul flight or an extended day in the office. With the charging case, they'll get up to 24 hours, which again, is an improvement over the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.\nYou should buy the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro if...\n1. You don't use Apple devices\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro earbuds don't just work well with Samsung devices -- they work well with Android devices in general. On an Android phone, you can download the Samsung Wear app to control the earbuds. From there, you can select noise modes, change the EQ, and more. There's no Samsung Wear app for iOS.\nSome features work best with Samsung phones, though. For starters, your Samsung phone should immediately recognize the earbuds and pair with them when you open the lid.\nAlso: 7 reasons why I choose Android over iOS (and sideloading is not one of them)\nOn top of that, there are some AI-focused features, like an Interpreter app that can translate speech in other languages, similar to the AirPods Pro 3's new Live Translation feature. Other features work like those on Apple devices, like an Auto Switch feature for your Galaxy phones and wearables, a hearing enhancement feature, and more.\nTo access the full suite of the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro's features, you'll need a Samsung phone. But, unless you really care about those super-specific features, you'll have a good experience on any Android device.\n2. You want to customize your listening experience\nThe most important consideration when buying earbuds is what phone you use. You're not going to buy AirPods if you have an Android phone or the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro if you have an iPhone. But other aspects of these earbuds can make a difference in how you use them. Notably, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro offer more audio customization than the AirPods Pro 3.\nAlso: Finally, a Samsung phone that I'd put my S25 Ultra away for (especially at this price)\nApple, after all, thinks the AirPods already sound amazing -- why would you want to change how they sound? Most other earbud manufacturers take a more customizable approach, and with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, you'll get a nine-band EQ, with bands ranging from 63Hz to 16kHz. On top of the custom EQ, there are a number of presets you can use if you don't want to get into the weeds of tuning the audio yourself.\n3. You want deeper, harder-hitting bass\nThe Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro aren't just more customizable when it comes to audio; they also offer bigger and deeper bass. That doesn't mean they sound better, necessarily. In fact, the bass on the AirPods Pro 3 is more natural-sounding, which appeals more to me personally. But if you're a fan of big bass -- and there's certainly no shame in that -- then the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are the better earbuds for your needs.",
