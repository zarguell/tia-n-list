    "raw": "CPT vs. Bounties: CPT is a time-boxed, structured test for compliance reports with a fixed cost. Bug Bounty is ongoing, open-ended discovery paid per valid vulnerability found. Mitigate Key Risks: Watch for poor researcher vetting, potential data exposure/exfiltration by bad actors, and labor misclassification risks from global contractor engagement. Selection Essentials: Demand rigorous identity verification, confirmed CREST certification for reports, and ethical procurement policies ensuring fair labor standards. Crowdsourced penetration testing promises broad coverage, flexible resourcing, and cost efficiency by tapping into a distributed pool of security testers. Trustwave, A LevelBlue Company, realizes not every organization has the financial resources to partner with a security firm with dedicated penetration testing capabilities. At the same time, we want to make organizations aware of the many pitfalls in the crowdsourced pen-testing market and offer a few pointers on choosing the right vendors. While the benefits of crowdsourced penetration testing are real, so are the risks distinctive to this brand of testing. These can include fake testing agencies, tax implications, and even ethical procurement. To get a better handle on how crowd-based services are delivered, let&rsquo;s look at who&rsquo;s doing the work, the data and operational risks to your organization, and practical controls you can use to make informed procurement and governance decisions. Defining Crowdsourced Penetration Testing The term itself is not well-known, but to make it easier, let&rsquo;s think of it as a close cousin to a bug bounty program, but keep in mind that while the similarities are clear, the differences can be quite stark. A bug bounty program is primarily focused on continuous vulnerability discovery and is designed to run indefinitely, or on an always-on basis, allowing for ongoing risk reduction. It typically has a broad and open-ended scope, often covering all public-facing assets. Because the hackers operate with a freestyle and unstructured methodology, the organization benefits from a large, diverse crowd of testers. The financial model is pay-for-results, meaning the company only pays a bounty for valid, unique vulnerabilities that are found, which can make the total cost unpredictable. The main output is a running list of validated vulnerability reports and security metrics. In contrast, crowdsourced penetration testing is geared towards a structured, time-boxed assessment to fulfill compliance needs or test a new feature. These engagements are time-bound, lasting for a specific period, and operate within a specific and controlled scope defined before the test begins. The testers are a curated, smaller team of highly vetted experts who follow a structured and methodology-driven approach. This results in a comprehensive final report that is ideal for satisfying compliance requirements (like SOC 2 or PCI DSS). The cost is typically a fixed fee or a blended model, providing a more predictable budget. A company should consider crowdsourced penetration testing when they are interested in rooting out lower-risk activities, or when conducting external testing where an organization is not letting the penetration tester in the door. Additionally, price plays a role. Crowdsourced penetration testing tends to be lower cost. How Crowdsourced Penetration Services Are Delivered In a similar manner to a bug bounty program, most crowdsourced testing is delivered through an intermediary platform that coordinates testers, scopes engagements, and aggregates results. Platforms vary widely in how they operate: some are primarily marketplaces (connecting buyers to individual testers), others deliver managed programs (vetting, triage, reporting, and post-test remediation support.) The key differences that affect your risk profile include: Whether the platform manages identity and vetting centrally or leaves it to buyers. How the platform handles disclosure, triage, and remediation workflows. The contractual relationship: direct hire of testers vs. contracting with a platform-as-a-service provider. The Pros and Cons of Global vs Regional Resources Using global testers increases scale and specialized skills (useful for niche technologies) but raises regulatory, legal, and supply-chain risks (export control, cross-border data flows, varying labor laws). Regional resources may offer stronger legal recourse, easier background checks, and cultural/contextual advantages &mdash; but smaller talent pools and potentially higher costs. Who is doing the work &mdash; vetting and trust. Vetting of resources Not all testers are equal, and a proper vetting program is imperative not only to get good results but to protect your organization. Effective vetting should include: Identity verification (document checks, two-factor identification). Criminal / police checks where appropriate and lawful. Skills validation (certificates like CREST challenge tasks, past program history). Reputation metrics (platform ratings, peer endorsements, previously published research). Ensuring the Testers Are Who They Say They Are A major risk with open crowds is impersonation and false identities. Poor vetting can allow criminals or fraudsters to participate and gain entry to your systems. These can include letting state-sponsored or malicious actors who can use testing access as a cover. Risk scenario: A bad actor passes a poorly designed and executed vetting process, is granted scoped access, and later exfiltrates data or establishes persistence under the guise of testing. Potential Exploitation of Workers Crowdsourced models can create labor risks that expose your organization not only to legal issues but also to moral ones. Taxation and superannuation exposure: Are workers engaged as contractors or employees? Misclassification risks can create liability for platforms or buyers. Modern slavery/worker protection: Some platforms may source testers from jurisdictions with poor labor protections; you should consider whether working conditions or coercive practices are involved. Ethical procurement: include clauses requiring platforms to adhere to labor standards and to supply transparency about their worker engagement model. Security Operations Center (SOC) Complacency During Testing One issue to be aware of is SOC complacency. If your SOC treats crowd testing as a controlled exercise, real adversarial activity may be ignored, or conversely, testers may be mistaken for adversaries. Either outcome reduces program value and increases risk. Quality of Deliverables Crowd testing results can range from one-line &ldquo;bug bounty-like&rdquo; reports to well-documented exploit chains with remediation advice. Ensure you specify the results you want at the end of testing in any contract. There are three common problems to avoid when arranging tests: Duplicate or low-value findings (noise). Poorly reproducible or insufficiently documented issues. Overly generic remediation advice. Pen Tester Skill Level Crowdsourcing excels at breadth (many scanners and testers run tests concurrently), but not all platforms guarantee depth. If you need advanced adversary simulation, confirm the required skill level and provide a sample of past work. Remember, there&rsquo;s a difference between: Scripted vulnerability scanning (automated, low custom skill) and Specialized offensive security experts (manual exploitation, creative attack paths). Obtaining the Best Results Possible Peer-review or triage processes significantly improve output quality. Look for platforms that: Triage and validate submissions before delivery. Provide a peer-review or second-opinion mechanism for complex findings. Offer a managed remediation tracking process. The key is not to treat the crowd as a black box: insist on strong vetting, clear contractual protections, technical controls that minimize exposure, and operational processes that preserve SOC effectiveness. When you combine those controls with sensible scoping and human triage, crowd testing becomes a powerful discovery engine &mdash; and not an unmanaged risk. In Summary To mitigate your risk and provide the highest value to your organization, look to the track record of your proposed penetration testing supplier, including the following: The heritage of your supplier, are they committed to your security? Independent references, whilst organizations will have Non-Disclosure Agreements in place, most organizations should be able to facilitate a call with a customer prior to contract execution. Industry certifications, CREST being a great example, allowing you to be sure that the cybersecurity companies you engage to test and protect your systems are reputable and competent. Ask for redacted example reports that align with your required scope, and know the quality of what you will receive in advance. Finally, if any of the points raised here give you pause, remember that Trustwave SpiderLabs has dedicated teams of pen testers with a long history of conducting highly effective tests that will improve your security.",
