    "raw": "Cybereason Threat Intelligence Team recently conducted an analysis of \"The Gentlemen\" ransomware group, which emerged around July 2025 as a ransomware threat actor group with relatively advanced methodologies. The Gentlemen group employs a dual-extortion strategy, not only encrypting sensitive files but also exfiltrating critical business data and threatening to publish it on dark web leak sites unless a ransom is paid. The group has demonstrated a unique approach by combining established ransomware techniques with newer strategies, making them quick to adapt to new attack vectors, allowing them to remain a persistent to evolving threat to organizations worldwide.",
