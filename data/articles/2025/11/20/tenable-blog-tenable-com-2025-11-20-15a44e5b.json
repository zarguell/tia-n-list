    "raw": "Fear of a bad patch causing downtime is justified, but manual patching leaves your organization exposed. See how Tenable Patch Management provides autonomy with customizable rules and guardrails, allowing you to rapidly remediate critical vulnerabilities without risking business disruption.Key takeaways:Fear of automated patching is real. No organization can afford to risk downtime from a poorly executed patch.&nbsp;The solution? Autonomous patching rather than rigid automation. Intelligent, autonomous tools solve the control issue by using customizable rules and guardrails, giving IT teams the power to pause or roll back problematic patches.&nbsp;Tenable Patch Management closes the gap between IT and security by automatically correlating vulnerabilities to patches and prioritizing remediation based on actual business risk.Let's be frank: \"automated patching\" can be a scary phrase. For years, IT and security teams have been caught in a tough spot. You’re told to remediate faster and improve SLAs while the volume of vulnerabilities goes up. You may have looked at options for automating this process in the past only to move on when you feel that familiar fear in the pit of your stomach. You’ve heard (or, possibly, lived) the horror story of a single automated patch taking down a critical server, triggering an outage, and turning a \"fix\" into a company-wide fire drill.Your fear isn't mere paranoia; it's based on valid business risk.The (very) high cost of a bad patchThe number one fear is IT downtime, and the cost of that downtime is astronomical. For large enterprises, four in 10 say the cost of a single hour of downtime is $1 million to $5 million. A massive telecom outage in 2022, caused by a bad firmware patch, knocked out services for over 10 million users and cut off 9-1-1 calls.So, yes, the fear is justified. But sticking to manual, reactive patching is a bigger problem.The manual patching hangoverThe typical workflow between IT and security — where the vulnerability management team discovers a vulnerability, exports it to a spreadsheet, and hands it off to IT to patch — just isn't working. It's slow, disruptive, and leaves organizations dangerously exposed.\"The State of Patch Management 2025\" report from Adaptiva and Demand Metric paints a pretty clear picture:It's a huge disruption: 98% of IT and security pros say patching disrupts their other work.It’s still too slow: 77% of organizations need more than a week to deploy patches.It’s causing real damage: 54% of organizations have experienced business disruptions from security incidents caused by delayed or incomplete patching.The data shows that 94% of organizations plan to automate patching. However, only 25% have actually achieved high levels of automation. That gap is where fear lives. Why? Because problematic automated deployments can lead to:Critical system failureLack of control and visibilityA false sense of securityThe problem isn't \"automation\" itself, it’s the type of automation. Historically, teams were stuck with rigid, \"all-or-nothing\" tools that didn't offer control. That’s where intelligent autonomous patching comes in.Tenable Patch Management: It’s not automation, it’s autonomy (with guardrails)The biggest fear of automation is losing control. What if a patch is problematic? How do you stop it?Tenable Patch Management is built to solve this exact problem. It’s designed to autonomously patch with a customizable rules engine. This means you get the speed of automation without sacrificing control. You have the real-time power to pause, cancel, or even roll back patches if something goes wrong. You can build customizable workflows with exceptions for specific systems, versions, applications, and more.Such flexibility is a world away from the traditional, \"mature\" patching process, which involves creating hundreds of complex, brittle rules for every single OS and software version.With Tenable Patch Management, the workflow is radically simpler:Build patch strategies: Define how and when patches should deploy based on risk. For example, you can create a policy to automatically patch critical vulnerabilities, like those with a critical Tenable Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) score, within 48 hours, but give yourself seven days for \"highs\".Apply to groups: Apply these strategies to specific groups of users, applications, devices, and more.Set it and forget it: Once configured, the system patches autonomously, letting your team get back time each month to focus on higher priority tasks. Organizations that adopt this autonomous approach are far more likely to deploy patches in three days or less than those using manual processes.Unifying security and IT with Tenable Patch ManagementLegacy patching methods force teams to work from different data sets. The security team prioritizes vulnerabilities based on exploitability. The IT team gets a spreadsheet from security and has to manually research which patches fix which CVEs. It's no wonder 64% of pros say their biggest challenge is simply coordination between detection and remediation.Tenable Patch Management closes this gap by unifying vulnerability management and patch management programs. And it does so at scale, so even the largest organizations are supported. In short: Tenable Patch Management pairs our leading exposure management capabilities with enterprise-scale remediation capabilities.Here’s how Tenable Patch Management works differently from legacy patching processes — and even from other patch tools on the market:Automated correlation: The system automatically correlates vulnerabilities to the exact patch needed to fix them. This eliminates hours of manual research and ensures your teams are looking at the same data.Risk-based prioritization: IT teams get access to Tenable's VPR and Asset Criticality Rating (ACR) scores. This means they can prioritize remediation based on actual risk, not just a CVSS or EPSS score.Peer-to-peer delivery: Worried about performance? The system uses patented peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to deliver patches quickly and efficiently, without overwhelming your network.It's time to stop the patching panicShifting from a reactive to a proactive vulnerability remediation strategy is no longer a \"nice to have.\" The risk of downtime due to a bad patch is real, but the risk of exposure that comes from delayed patching is a potentially greater threat to your business. With Tenable Patch Management, you can finally adopt autonomous patching with the confidence and control your teams have always needed. You get to stop firefighting, ditch the spreadsheets, and focus on building a more secure, resilient organization.Ready to see Tenable Patch Management in action? Check out our guided demo:&nbsp;",
