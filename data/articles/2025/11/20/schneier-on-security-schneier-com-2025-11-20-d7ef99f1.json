    "raw": "Google has filed a complaint in court that details the scam: In a complaint filed Wednesday, the tech giant accused &#8220;a cybercriminal group in China&#8221; of selling &#8220;phishing for dummies&#8221; kits. The kits help unsavvy fraudsters easily “execute a large-scale phishing campaign,” tricking hordes of unsuspecting people into “disclosing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or banking information, often by impersonating well-known brands, government agencies, or even people the victim knows.” These branded &#8220;Lighthouse&#8221; kits offer two versions of software, depending on whether bad actors want to launch SMS and e-commerce scams. &#8220;Members may subscribe to weekly, monthly, seasonal, annual, or permanent licenses,&#8221; Google alleged. Kits include &#8220;hundreds of templates for fake websites, domain set-up tools for those fake websites, and other features designed to dupe victims into believing they are entering sensitive information on a legitimate website.&#8221; Google’s filing said the scams often begin with a text claiming that a toll fee is overdue or a small fee must be paid to redeliver a package. Other times they appear as ads&#8212;­sometimes even Google ads, until Google detected and suspended accounts&#8212;­luring victims by mimicking popular brands. Anyone who clicks will be redirected to a website to input sensitive information; the sites often claim to accept payments from trusted wallets like Google Pay.",
