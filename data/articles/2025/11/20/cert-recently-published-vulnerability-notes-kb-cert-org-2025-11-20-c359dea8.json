    "raw": "Overview A command injection vulnerability exists across multiple firmware versions that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the affected device. Currently, no solution exists to resolve these vulnerabilities in the Tenda N300 series and Tenda 4G03 Pro devices. Description Tenda 4G03 Pro is a portable 4G LTE router that is designed to provide for flexible internet access. It is a plug-and-play device compatible with mobile operators globally, allowing you to insert a SIM card for ad-hoc internet access. Multiple components within this model of Tenda 4G LTE router is impacted by command injection flaws that stem from improper handling of attacker-controlled input passed to internal service functions. CVE-2025-13207 In Firmware up to and including v04.03.01.44, manipulation of arguments passed to a function within the service /usr/sbin/httpd can be exploited. A crafted, authenticated HTTP request to TCP port 80 can trigger arbitrary command execution. CVE-2024-24481 In Firmware up to and including v04.03.01.14, improper input handling within an accessible function leads to a similar command injection condition. An authenticated attacker can invoke the function through the web interface, after which a crafted network request to TCP port 7329 can result in command execution. This issue is distinct from CVE-2023-2649. These vulnerabilities were identified through reverse engineering of the firmware. At this time, no fixed firmware is available to address these vulnerabilities. Impact Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the underlying operating system, allowing attacker to take Total control of the device. Solution The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a vendor-supplied patch or mitigation for these vulnerabilities. Use an alternative device: Because no remediation is currently available, users who rely on this device in security-sensitive may consider other devices for such access. Reduce exposure where possible: If replacement is not immediately feasible, limit usage to reduce risk of abuse. Monitor for vendor updates: Users should periodically check for firmware updates or advisories from Tenda in case a patch becomes available in the future.
