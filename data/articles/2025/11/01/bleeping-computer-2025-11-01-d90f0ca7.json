    "full": "China-linked cyber-espionage actors tracked as 'Bronze Butler' (Tick) exploited a Motex Lanscope Endpoint Manager vulnerability as a zero-day to deploy an updated version of their Gokcpdoor malware.\nThe discovery of this activity comes from Sophos researchers, who observed the threat actors exploiting the vulnerability in mid-2025 before it was patched to steal confidential information.\nThe flaw exploited in these attacks is CVE-2025-61932, a critical request origin verification flaw impacting Motex Lanscope Endpoint Manager versions 9.4.7.2 and earlier. It enables unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target with SYSTEM privileges via specially crafted packets.\nMotex released fixes for CVE-2025-61932 on October 20, 2025, with CISA adding the flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog last week, urging federal agencies to patch by November 12, 2025.\nNeither the vendor nor CISA shared specific details about the detected exploitation in their bulletins. However, Sophos' latest report indicates that CVE-2025-61932 has been under exploitation by hackers for at least a couple of months.\nBronze Butler leveraged CVE-2025-61932 to deploy the Gokcpdoor malware on targets, which establishes a proxy connection with the attackers' command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.\nIn the newest version seen in these attacks, Gokcpdoor has dropped support for the KCP protocol and added multiplexed C2 communication.\nSophos researchers have sampled two variants of the malware, a server implementation that listens for client connections on ports 38000 and 38002, and a client that connects to hard-coded C2 addresses and functions as a backdoor.\nIn some cases, the attackers employed the Havoc C2 framework instead, but in all instances, the final payload was loaded by OAED Loader and injected into legitimate executables using DLL sideloading for evasion.\nSophos also reports that Bronze Butler used the goddi Active Directory dumper, Remote Desktop, and the 7-Zip archiver tool for data exfiltration.\nThe hackers likely used cloud-based storage services as exfiltration points, with Sophos noting access to io, LimeWire, and Piping Server.\nOrganizations using Lanscope Endpoint Manager are recommended to upgrade their clients to a version that addresses CVE-2025-61932. Currently, there are no workarounds or mitigations for the vulnerability, so patching is the only recommended action.\nThe 2026 CISO Budget Benchmark\nIt's budget season! Over 300 CISOs and security leaders have shared how they're planning, spending, and prioritizing for the year ahead. This report compiles their insights, allowing readers to benchmark strategies, identify emerging trends, and compare their priorities as they head into 2026.\nLearn how top leaders are turning investment into measurable impact.",
