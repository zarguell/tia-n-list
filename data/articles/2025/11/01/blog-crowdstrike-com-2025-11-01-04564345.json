    "full": "We're proud to announce that CrowdStrike has been recognized as the Growth and Innovation Leader in the 2025 Frost Radar™ for SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) for the second consecutive time. This recognition validates our commitment to providing security solutions for some of the most pressing threats modern organizations face.\nThreat actors are exploiting business-critical SaaS applications that power modern businesses. \"The rapid proliferation of SaaS applications has outpaced many organizations’ ability to maintain visibility and control, exposing critical security gaps and increasing the likelihood of data breaches due to insufficient SaaS-specific protections,\" Frost & Sullivan states.\nThese blind spots are exactly what adversaries target. Threat actors with valid credentials can gain legitimate access to SaaS apps. What’s more, the rapid expansion of SaaS has created a sprawling identity ecosystem. Many security teams lack visibility into human and non-human identities, leaving excessive privileges, orphaned accounts, and risky integrations unchecked. Without full visibility and threat detection, adversaries can exploit these identities to gain access and operate undetected while exfiltrating data, establishing persistence, and moving across interconnected SaaS and hybrid environments.\nCrowdStrike Falcon® Shield is a transformative approach to SaaS security that transcends traditional standalone SSPM solutions due to its fully native integration with the broader CrowdStrike Falcon® platform. Frost & Sullivan states Falcon Shield achieved exceptional year-over-year growth of over 219% in 2025, significantly outpacing the market. This growth is a testament to the strong demand for CrowdStrike’s approach to SaaS security.\nSaaS Security Powered by the Falcon Platform\nFrost & Sullivan recognizes how Falcon Shield’s integration with the unified, AI-native Falcon platform powers a fast and more comprehensive defense against SaaS threats.\n“CrowdStrike Falcon Shield’s unified architecture that combines SaaS, endpoint, and identity data into a single console enables unmatched correlation and contextual risk insights across the entire security stack,” Frost & Sullivan states. “By integrating with Falcon Identity Protection, it correlates identity security with SaaS telemetry to create unified profiles for HI [human identities] and NHI [non-human identities].”\nThis “integration with Falcon’s broader modules deliver fast, orchestrated response workflows that reduce operational complexity and mean time to remediation, making it uniquely effective among SSPM solutions,” the report adds.\nFrost & Sullivan also praised how CrowdStrike both secures AI agents and leverages agentic AI for SaaS security through the CrowdStrike® Charlotte AI™ agentic system: “Charlotte AI allows users to write natural language queries, gain threat intelligence insights, and receive security guidance and automated analysis,” with sophisticated automated remediation, the report states.\nWith CrowdStrike Falcon® Fusion SOAR, powered by Charlotte AI, organizations can configure workflow automation. Automated remediation is crucial for addressing threats like OAuth token abuse, as it enables security teams to rapidly revoke malicious authorizations and adjust identity-based access controls before adversaries can establish persistence.",
    "processed": "CrowdStrike named Growth and Innovation Leader in 2025 Frost Radar for SSPM. Threat actors exploit SaaS application sprawl and identity management gaps, using valid credentials to access apps, move laterally, and exfiltrate data. Lack of visibility into human and non-human identities, excessive privileges, orphaned accounts, and risky integrations are key vulnerabilities. CrowdStrike Falcon Shield offers integrated SaaS, identity, and endpoint security to mitigate these risks."
