      "full": "The convenience and scalability of cloud email have become indispensable for modern organizations. Yet, this digital transformation also ushers in a new era of sophisticated and evolving threats, with a steady increase in advanced attacks like account takeovers and financially devastating business email compromise (BEC). These aren’t just phishing attempts; they are highly targeted, intelligently crafted assaults designed to bypass traditional defenses, compromise your brand, and cripple operations.\nIn such a dynamic environment, relying on fragmented security solutions isn’t effective and typically causes security gaps. It’s no longer enough to simply filter spam; organizations need a comprehensive, cloud-scale email security platform that fortifies existing investments, is simple to deploy, and provides robust, end-to-end protection.\nThis is where the power of a unified platform truly shines. Imagine a solution that seamlessly integrates gateway-level prevention with supplemental, API-based post-delivery remediation. This isn’t about adding more layers; it’s about creating a single, intelligent ecosystem. Such a platform provides critical visibility and context that empowers security professionals to act swiftly and decisively. It means blocking threats before they reach the mailbox, monitoring internal communications for anomalies, and having the tools to remediate compromised emails even after they’ve landed.\nCisco Secure Email Threat Defense at the forefront of innovation\nBacked by over two decades of email gateway expertise, Secure Email Threat Defense brings the next wave of email security to your organization — it’s now a gateway solution!\nUntil now, Email Threat Defense has been known for its exceptional detection and protection capabilities — backed by proven threat intelligence and advanced analytics. With this new deployment mode, Email Threat Defense can now operate as a standalone email security gateway, providing organizations with even more flexibility in how they defend against evolving email threats.\nThis enhancement means Email Threat Defense doesn’t just rely on what it already does brilliantly — it’s now supercharged with additional gateway capabilities. The result is deeper insights, smarter threat detection, and even better protection against phishing, spoofing, and other advanced email-based attacks. Recent third-party testing from SE Labs and analyst reporting by KuppingerCole celebrates these new levels of efficacy.\nA new licensing tier to simplify ordering and deployment\nThe Advantage tier of our Email Threat Defense platform unifies multiple deployment modes into a single, flexible solution. This means comprehensive pre-delivery threat prevention and post-delivery remediation via APIs – all configured and managed from one streamlined console. It improves detection speed and remediation capabilities by processing messages at the perimeter, identifying threats and stopping them before they enter the organization. By harnessing cloud-scale AI, we eliminate the limitations of traditional appliance-based systems, reducing administrative burden and providing robust security in a simplified way.\nBecause Email Threat Defense supports working as a first hop or relay; it easily pairs with customers’ existing gateways and mail platforms like Microsoft 365 and Gmail.\nImportant to an XDR and breach strategy\nEmail Threat Defense is more than just an email security product; it’s a critical component of your extended detection and response (XDR) strategy. By integrating with the broader Cisco Security portfolio and third-party partners, it delivers the visibility, efficiency, and telemetry needed to empower your team to respond quickly to threats.\nDon’t let the evolving threat landscape leave your organization vulnerable. Modernize your email security with a singular, continuously evolving, advanced platform.\nStart a free trial of Email Threat Defense today and experience the difference in truly comprehensive protection.\nWe’d love to hear what you think!
