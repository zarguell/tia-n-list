    "raw": "This webinar will show you how to transform raw intelligence into a dynamic and actionable defense strategy. We'll start with a real-world scenario sourced from Google Threat Intelligence, demonstrating how to extract key indicators and behaviors. From there, we'll use the power of agents powered by Gemini to build a robust threat model. We'll show you a step-by-step process, starting with a sequence of prompts to guide the creation of a threat hunt and then using intelligent agents to help automate and operationalize the entire workflow. Join Muhammad Muneer, Principal Incident Response Consultant and Joseliyo Sánchez, Security Engineer as they show you how to move beyond manual analysis and use advanced AI to accelerate your threat hunting capabilities, enabling you to: - Proactively defend against modern threats with speed and precision - Use AI tools to react quicker to threats when needed - Enhance your current SOC workflows Stop chasing alerts and start actively hunting threats. This is your chance to operationalize your threat intelligence and build a truly proactive defense with Google Cloud.",
