    "raw": "Artificial intelligence has moved from experimentation to execution, and with it, the enterprise’s attack surface has fundamentally changed. With generative, predictive and now autonomous “agentic” AI accelerating across the enterprise, CIOs must rethink security from the ground up. Traditional cyber defenses are no longer sufficient for the new frontlines formed by rapidly evolving AI systems. AI introduces unique vulnerabilities and it demands new security primitives and operational discipline. Why AI Security Is Different and Why It Matters AI systems introduce an attack surface fundamentally different from traditional applications. Adversaries now target both how models are built and how they behave: Data poisoning corrupts the recipe before it’s cooked, prompt injections manipulate core logic, while model hijacking and supply-chain compromise blend old and new threats into a single, converged risk vector. Meanwhile, the opacity of model behavior and the scale of enterprise AI adoption allow “shadow AI” (unvetted, undocumented and “rogue” systems) to proliferate beyond a CIO’s visibility. First Principles for AI Security Start with Primitives To lead effectively, CIOs must anchor their AI strategy in first principles, which are the fundamentals that transcend vendor hype and checkbox compliance. At Palo Alto Networks, this means reducing material risk through a prevention-first, zero trust and unified-platform architecture. These principles are realized through three foundational controls: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA), reimagined for the AI era. It begins with rigorous access management for training data and model code, ensuring adversaries cannot extract, manipulate or corrupt AI assets. Integrity demands traceability from input to output, including defenses against data and model poisoning, and enables human stakeholders to audit both the lineage and logic of AI-driven decisions. Availability extends beyond uptime: enterprises must anticipate and mitigate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), resource exhaustion and prompt manipulation must all be anticipated as AI systems become mission-critical. Secure by Design Embeds Security in the AI Lifecycle Security can’t be an afterthought; it must be engineered into the AI lifecycle from the start. Securing AI by Design embeds protection across the machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline, from data preparation and training to deployment and continuous monitoring. This helps enterprises eliminate systemic vulnerabilities, enforce compliance and innovate with confidence at scale. Zero Blind Spots, See the Whole Picture The CIO’s first mandate is to illuminate every corner of the AI ecosystem. Traditional network perimeters collapse when data flows freely among internal systems, third-party GenAI services and autonomous agents. Achieving true visibility means mapping every API, data source, model and browser interaction. This creates a real-time inventory of all AI activity, including shadow AI. Security leaders must eliminate blind spots before the first line of AI code is written, establishing a comprehensive view of the entire AI attack surface. Frameworks, like NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF), provide a valuable foundation, but lasting protection demands a full-coverage security blueprint, not reactive patches applied after risks are already in production. Protect the Data, Protect the Model The intelligence of an AI system is only as trustworthy as the data and prompts it consumes. Protecting that intelligence requires strict access controls, rigorous data validation, tracing lineage to verified sources, as well as safeguards to prevent sensitive information from leaking into external AI systems. Continuous monitoring ties it all together, detecting anomalies, drift or misuse before they escalate. Robust data lineage is critical; it enables rapid identification of corrupted or poisoned inputs, safeguarding the model’s logic, the integrity of its decisions, and the trust placed in its outcomes. Establish a Defensible Supply Chain The security posture of any AI product is defined by its weakest link. CIOs must secure the entire AI supply chain against vulnerabilities introduced through external components. This requires enforcing secure coding standards, leveraging specialized vulnerability scanning tailored for AI artifacts, and locking down all pretrained components and open-source dependencies used in development. The outcome is an auditable, trustworthy pathway from inception to deployment. It is one that minimizes third-party risk and provides integrity across the AI lifecycle. Preempt Failure by Eliminating Rogue Behavior AI models are probabilistic, not deterministic, making them uniquely vulnerable to deception. Preventing adversarial takeover or sensitive data leakage requires embedding continuous, specialized AI red teaming throughout the pipeline, along with total visibility into user interactions with GenAI tools. Testing must validate that the model's ethical and business guardrails cannot be bypassed through sophisticated prompt injection or other manipulation techniques. Every system should be engineered to fail safely, even when under direct adversarial attack. Stay Resilient, Always Risk doesn't end at deployment; continuous operation is the ultimate test. The final mandate is to help ensure safe, reliable performance in real-world conditions. This requires enforcing robust, AI-specific access and policy controls at the API layer, combined with real-time, AI-aware monitoring. Such vigilance is essential to detect subtle model drifts, compliance breaches and anomalous agent behaviors, enabling systems to self-correct and adapt to live threats with minimal human intervention. Tooling and Modern Security Architecture AI systems demand a modern security toolchain, including model security scanners, dynamic red teaming, runtime monitors, vector database–aware access controls, as well as AI-specific DLP solutions. These are not optional add-ons but essential enablers of resilience, designed to defend against unauthorized access, data leakage and subtle exploitation rooted in the probabilistic nature of AI. A Quick-Start Checklist 1. Do we have a complete view of our AI footprint? Do we know where all the risk is? Can we see every model, agent, dataset and dependency (including shadow AI), and do we understand their business criticality? 2. Are we prepared for the new types of attacks? Have we identified adversarial incentives and risks across business, data and supply chain layers? 3. Is security built in or bolted on? Do project plans include compliance, privacy and security requirements from day one? 4. How do we validate AI systems under stress? Are adversarial testing and AI-specific red teaming performed regularly, and are results visible to leadership? 5. Are we enforcing consistent guardrails across the entire AI ecosystem? Are access, logging and policy enforcement standardized across data, models and APIs? 6. Are we flying blind postdeployment? Do monitoring systems alert us instantly to anomalies, policy violations or model drift? 7. Is AI security truly owned at every level? Does accountability extend from the board to line-of-business owners with a clear culture of transparency and shared responsibility? Executive Accountability Leads from the Top Leadership sets the tone. Every decision a CIO makes about AI is also a decision about risk, trust and resilience. The responsibility for AI security is not merely a technical imperative but an executive mandate. CIOs must champion a culture where security is owned, not delegated, where radical transparency is practiced through detailed Bills of Materials for AI components, and open sharing of red team results, and where accountability is embedded through executive-level oversight. Forward-thinking enterprises are now establishing coordinated, multidisciplinary AI security councils that span security, development, compliance and business teams. The goal is clear: Make AI security a shared, organization-wide discipline. The reality is simple: AI will be used everywhere, by everyone – employees, partners and adversaries. CIOs don’t need another tool for another problem; they need confidence that their security architecture holistically protects the two core aspects of enterprise AI adoption. How AI Is Used – Address the new browser-based workspace where employees interact with GenAI. Unsafe usage can expose data and people in seconds. The security architecture must deliver immediate visibility and control to enable safe adoption without slowing innovation. How AI Is Built and Deployed – End-to-end protection for applications, agents, models and data across training, deployment and runtime. The architecture must guarantee the integrity and resilience of the AI systems that power the business. A modern, unified security platform is the only way to address both pillars simultaneously. Palo Alto Networks unifies these capabilities into one integrated AI security platform, providing the foundation needed to secure AI end to end and enable the next decade of innovation.

AI systems expand the attack surface beyond traditional software and networks. Threats like data poisoning, model hijacking and prompt injection exploit how AI learns and behaves. Protecting AI requires new security primitives (including model integrity, data lineage validation and continuous monitoring) that go beyond conventional defenses. How can CIOs apply first principles to secure AI by design? CIOs can anchor their strategy on three reimagined first principles: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. That means enforcing strict access to AI assets, ensuring traceability from input to output, and maintaining operational resilience against new AI-specific attacks. These principles unify governance, architecture and execution under a prevention-first mindset. What are the first steps enterprises should take to build a defensible AI security posture? CIOs should begin by mapping their AI footprint (including models, datasets, agents and external dependencies) to eliminate blind spots. From there, establish continuous visibility, enforce standardized guardrails across data and model pipelines, and integrate red teaming into MLOps. These steps create a measurable baseline for resilience and enable AI security to become part of day-one design, not day-two reaction.
