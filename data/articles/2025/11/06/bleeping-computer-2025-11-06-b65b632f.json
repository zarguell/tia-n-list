      "full": "By Sila Ozeren Hacioglu, Security Research Engineer at Picus Security.\nIn many organizations, red and blue teams still work in silos, usually pitted against each other, with the offense priding itself on breaking in and the defense doing what they can to hold the line.\nHowever, too often, their efforts don’t meet in the middle, creating noise. The red team runs an exercise, publishes findings, and moves on, while the blue team is flooded with a sea of unvalidated vulnerability alerts and rules. It may seem like progress, but it’s not. The offense identifies gaps once; the defense fights, essentially blind, day in and day out.\nPurple teaming rewrites this equation. It brings red and blue together, not to compete, but to collaborate, turning testing into a shared process and validation into measurable evidence.\nThe key to making this collaboration far more valuable is Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS), which enables real-time, ongoing, continuous validation.\nBecause the truth is this: attackers evolve faster than defenses can coordinate, and only through continuous validation can we close the gap.\nPurple Teaming Isn’t a Color Wheel, It’s the Key to Real Cyber Defense\nPurple teaming isn’t “friendlier red teaming.” It’s a fundamentally more effective workflow, continuously turning every offensive run into a defensive improvement. The workflow goes like this:\n-\nRed attacks. They emulate adversaries with precision, revealing where defenses hold or give way.\n-\nBlue responds. They trace which controls fire, which stay silent, and why.\n-\nThen both go again, fixing, rerunning, and refining until the gaps close.\nThat loop, not the color, is what makes a team truly purple.\nAs Chris Dale, Principal Instructor at SANS, put it during our recent BAS Summit:\n“I want to see less of this red versus blue. I want convergence. I want us making one another good.”\nPurple teaming makes that convergence real.\nReplacing rivalry with collaboration, purple teaming turns testing into an ongoing cycle of validation and improvement. In a field where the stakes are this high and speed and precision can define survival, this isn’t just a better mindset; it’s the only logical way forward.\nManual No More: How BAS Powers Continuous Purple Teaming\nManual purple teaming is slow.\nEach new adversary campaign takes hours of scripting, staging, and tuning. By the time a kill chain is ready, new campaigns may already be underway, and your organization might already appear in public reporting.\nNow you can eliminate that lag, automating the manual tasks that traditionally slow down or stop progress. BAS:\n-\nContinuously simulates real-world adversaries using TTPs mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework\n-\nSafely executes simulated payloads against live controls, and\n-\nInstantly scores your prevention, detection, and response effectiveness.\nHere, automation doesn’t replace human creativity; it amplifies it, enabling faster, more accurate validation.\nAs Picus Co-Founder & CTO Volkan Ertürk stressed in the BAS Summit, “BAS is the voltage test of modern security, the current you run through your stack to see what holds.”\nWith BAS, purple teaming stops being a one-off event and becomes a productive rhythm. Attack. Observe. Fix. Validate. Repeat.\nMake Purple Teaming Continuous, Not Occasional\nSee how the Picus Security Validation Platform helps you run continuous purple teaming.\nAutomate real adversary simulations, validate every control, and turn collaboration between red and blue teams into a proven defensive strength.\nGet a DemoPick a Fight That Matters\nDon’t lead with a compliance checklist. Start with what will actually burn you.\nFocus on realistic, high-impact attack paths an adversary would use to gain access to your crown jewels:\n-\ninternal recon → privilege escalation → lateral movement (WMI, PsExec) → persistence (registry, scheduled tasks) → data exfiltration → encryption & backup tampering (e.g., shadow-copy deletion).\nScope that attack chain to the controls meant to stop or detect it, firewalls, WAFs, email gateways, IPS/IDS, EDR/XDR, and run the scenario in BAS safely to measure prevention, detection, and response.\nWatch the stack:\n-\nWhat fired? — Those controls worked.\n-\nWhat stayed silent? — Make this your top remediation priority.\n-\nWhat alerted on signatures rather than behavior/technique? — This is noise; retune so detections map to technique.\nClose the Loop Based on Validated Prioritization\nEvery attack simulation run by BAS generates evidence, and allows you to immediately act on the gaps it’s uncovered.\nThis way, you can prioritize what slipped through both prevention and detection; these are the real risks that your defenses failed to block or detect.\nSimilarly, you can then deprioritize vulnerabilities that your existing controls already mitigate; not every CVSS-critical vulnerability needs to be patched, especially if compensating controls are already in place and actively preventing exploitation.\nExamine every remaining gap and assess it using three factors:\n-\nImpact: How significant would the damage be if exploited?\n-\nDetectability: How easy is it to detect with existing tools?\n-\nBusiness Context: Where does this exposure sit in your environment, and what assets would it affect if exploited?\nIn today’s complicated environments, fixing everything at once is impractical, if not impossible. Focus on the most critical gaps first: the highest-impact and least-detectable ones that can lead to an actual breach.\nThis process shortens the loop between exposure and response.\nMeasure Reality, Not Volume\nFocus on what has truly improved:\n-\nTime-to-detect before vs. after the implementation of BAS.\n-\nMean time to validate a fix and confirm its effectiveness.\n-\nPercentage of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that are detected and prevented.\nThese metrics will show you whether red and blue team collaboration is truly driving progress or if you're simply going through the motions.\nAs Jaime Rodriguez, Offensive Security & Threat Intelligence Leader at Sutter Health, put it: \"It's a continuous loop of validation we can run anytime, anywhere.\"\nThe goal isn’t just to run attacks for the sake of it. It’s to close the gap between exposure and assurance, ensuring that your actual defenses are continuously validated and aligned with your security objectives.\nLeverage AI, Carefully\nAI can now quickly read a threat report and generate a complete emulation plan in minutes.\nWhile this is a major leap forward, it comes with significant risks. Volkan Ertürk warned, “Ask a large model (LLM) to build your payloads and you might find yourself simulating the wrong thing, for real.”\nA smarter approach is to:\n-\nUse AI to parse threat intelligence and map it to TTPs.\n-\nMaintain and update payloads in a curated BAS library for safety and quality.\n-\nAlways have your team review the plans before execution.\nAI should assist, not replace, human judgment. It can draft the plan, but your security team needs to decide what’s safe to run.\nBy doing so, AI eliminates the need for the traditional 48-hour mapping cycle, where security teams manually map out the threats they’ll include..\nRethink Success\nIf your red team still measures “domain admin achieved,” congratulations, you’re stuck in 2015.\nIf your blue team still celebrates 'alerts fired,' you're also living dangerously in the past.\nToday, success is measured by continuous proof derived from each sprint:\n-\nWhich TTPs were emulated?\n-\nWhich detections were tuned?\n-\nWhich fixes were re-validated?\nSecurity maturity isn’t how many tools you’ve deployed; it’s how often you verify they work.\nThe Payoff: Continuous Confidence\nAfter months of BAS-powered purple teaming, we see some fundamental, dramatic changes:\n-\nTeams aren’t debating hypothetical risks.\n-\nExecutives aren’t requesting assurance reports because they already have the data they need.\n-\nEvery patch, every mitigation, every rule has a concrete reason: tested, validated, and proven.\nAt this point, continuous validation becomes second nature, marking a fundamental shift in your teams’ security mindset.\nChris Dale’s keynote left a powerful statement: “Security doesn’t fail at the breach; it fails at the point of impact.”\nBAS-driven purple teaming is built to prevent that impact, not through assumptions or hope, but by rigorously testing your defenses, uncovering the truth, and empowering your team to act.\nRequest your demo now to adopt threat-centric purple teaming and validate your readiness against realistic adversary behaviors and closing the loop between exposure and assurance.\nSponsored and written by Picus Security.",
