    "raw": "Short-finned pilot wales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) eat at lot of squid: To figure out a short-finned pilot whale&#8217;s caloric intake, Gough says, the team had to combine data from a variety of sources, including movement data from short-lasting tags, daily feeding rates from satellite tags, body measurements collected via aerial drones, and sifting through the stomachs of unfortunate whales that ended up stranded on land. Once the team pulled all this data together, they estimated that a typical whale will eat between 82 and 202 squid a day. To meet their energy needs, a whale will have to consume an average of 140 squid a day. Annually, that&#8217;s about 74,000 squid per whale. For all the whales in the area, that amounts to about 88,000 tons of squid eaten every year. Research paper. As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven&#8217;t covered. Blog moderation policy.",
