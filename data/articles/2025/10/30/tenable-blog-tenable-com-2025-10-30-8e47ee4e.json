It correlates vulnerabilities, identities, and misconfigurations to prioritize exploitability and automate containment — helping teams detect, control, and remediate risks across multi-cloud and hybrid environments.Key takeaways:Vulnerabilities can emerge at any point in multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments — and the potential blast radius of exposure can jeopardize accounts, workloads and data.&nbsp;Siloed security tools can’t give teams the visibility they need across every layer of the cloud environment, including code, build, registry, and runtime. This results in overlooked vulnerabilities, duplicated efforts, and delayed remediation.&nbsp;Tenable Cloud Security gives teams a seamless and unified view across CI/CD pipelines, image registries, and multi-cloud environments. Findings are enriched with insight into exploitability, privilege, and exposure. The result? A clear picture of where the next breach could begin and how widespread its impact could be.Modern cloud environments move fast. Code is built, tested, and deployed across containers, registries, and workloads in minutes. Yet vulnerabilities can emerge at any point — from an unpatched library in a CI/CD pipeline to an image in production. Without holistic visibility across every stage of the software lifecycle, it’s easy for critical risks to slip through the cracks. Once they do, the potential blast radius of exposure can expand rapidly across accounts, workloads, and data.The challenge: Reducing the blast radiusMany security teams still rely on point tools or siloed scans. They might scan during CI/CD testing but lose sight of what happens after deployment — or focus on runtime protection without securing earlier stages.The result? Missed exposures, duplicate work, and delayed remediation — all of which increase the chance that vulnerabilities reach production and propagate across environments. To effectively reduce the blast radius, organizations need end-to-end visibility that connects every layer of the environment — code, build, registry, and runtime — into a single, contextual view. That’s what Tenable Cloud Security, part of the Tenable One Exposure Management Platform, delivers.A new approach to cloud security for multi-cloud and hybrid environmentsTenable Cloud Security connects the dots between vulnerabilities, identities, misconfigurations, and data exposure to show not just what’s vulnerable, but why it matters — and how to contain it before attackers can exploit it.Instead of juggling data from disconnected tools, teams gain one unified view that integrates seamlessly across CI/CD pipelines, image registries, and multi-cloud environments. Every finding is enriched with insight into exploitability, privilege, and exposure, creating a clear picture of not only where the next breach could begin but how widespread its impact could be — and steps you can take to proactively reduce the risk of a breach happening in the first place.Shrink the blast radius in the cloud with Tenable Cloud Security&nbsp;Tenable Cloud Security brings clarity and control to complex cloud environments through continuous visibility, context-driven prioritization, and automated containment. Teams can view vulnerabilities across all cloud accounts and workloads in a single interface, filtering by account, exploit maturity, or exposure level to focus on remediating the risks that matter most.Using Tenable’s Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) and the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), the platform dynamically adjusts vulnerability priorities based on active exploit data and real-world threat intelligence. This ensures that response efforts are always focused on the vulnerabilities most likely to be weaponized.It goes beyond traditional scanning by correlating vulnerabilities with network exposure, identity privileges, and data sensitivity — exposing toxic combinations such as a publicly accessible workload with administrative permissions and a critical CVE. With this context, teams can pinpoint not only which vulnerabilities are exploitable but also how an attacker might move laterally once inside.Through deep workload analysis, security teams can drill down into connected identities, network paths, and activity logs. Automated guardrails then restrict risky access, enforce segmentation, and isolate affected workloads before threats can spread.And because it’s part of Tenable One, these insights extend beyond the cloud, unifying visibility across IT, identity, and on-prem environments in a single exposure graph. Vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and entitlements are correlated into one dynamic risk model, making it easier than ever to see and contain potential attack paths.The bottom line: Discover, control, and remediate&nbsp;With Tenable Cloud Security, vulnerabilities no longer become open invitations for attackers. Security and DevOps teams can detect exposures early, prioritize them intelligently, and contain them automatically before they spread.By unifying discovery, context, and control, Tenable Cloud Security transforms vulnerability management from a reactive exercise into proactive containment. The result is a smaller blast radius, faster remediation, and greater confidence in the security of your cloud-native applications.Ready to learn more?
