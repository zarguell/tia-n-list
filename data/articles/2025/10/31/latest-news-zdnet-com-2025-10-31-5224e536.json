Now, according to a report from The Washington Post, several government agencies are officially backing a proposal by the Commerce Department to ban the sale of all of the company's networking devices in the US.\nAlso: Slow Wi-Fi? How to get wired internet at home without running an Ethernet cable\nShould the ban take effect, it would be one of the most sweeping product bans in consumer history.\nTP-Link is one of the most popular router brands globally. The company makes the majority of routers sold in US, it's the most popular router option on Amazon, and more than 300 ISPs send the brand's routers to customers. TP-Link even makes an appearance on our list of best routers.\nThe company's routers have been involved in several high-profile hacking incidents, though, which is leading government officials to question how secure the devices really are. TP-Link issued a patch for some of the affected devices, but some people say that's not enough.\nWhat happens now?\nAt this point, the Commerce Department can choose to drop the matter entirely, work out a compromise (such as only banning the government from buying them), or enact the ban. If it opts to ban, it must officially notify TP-Link, who would have 30 days to object. The Commerce Department would then have 30 more days to respond to the objection.\nAlso: I compared a traditional Wi-Fi router with a mesh setup - here's which one I recommend\nIf the ban were to happen, it would impact the sale/purchase of new devices. You'd most likely still be able to pick up a used TP-Link device if that's your preferred brand. If you insist on buying new, you'd simply shop from another manufacturer.\nGiven the company's market dominance, however, there's a fair chance we would see shortages in networking devices, which would almost certainly lead to higher prices for those currently on the market.\nWhen I reached out for comment, a spokesperson for TP-Link Systems Inc. (TP-Link's US subsidiary), noted that, \"No official action or confirmation has been made by any agency or the White House regarding these allegations.\" The Washington Post article, the spokesperson reiterated, reported that Commerce may still decide not to issue the ban, or could reach an agreement with TP-Link for a different resolution.\nAlso: The best Wi-Fi routers you can buy\n\"TP-Link Systems vigorously disputes any allegation that its products present national security risks to the US,\" the spokesperson said, adding that \"any concerns the government may have about TP-Link are fully resolvable by a common-sense mix of measures like onshoring development functions, investing in cybersecurity, and being transparent.\"\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter.",
