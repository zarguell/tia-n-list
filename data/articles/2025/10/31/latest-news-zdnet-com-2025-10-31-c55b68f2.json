We gather data from the best available sources, including vendor and retailer listings as well as other relevant and independent reviews sites.

All that's to say that my eyes take a beating from screen time, blue light exposure, and nitty-gritty writing and editing.\nAlso: The best early Black Friday deals\nThat's why I was desperate to find anything to help alleviate the discomfort of headaches and eye fatigue. Taking over-the-counter medications doesn't always cut it, and sometimes, the obvious solutions (more sleep, less stress, etc.) just aren't feasible. I decided to try Renpho's Eyeris 2 eye massager after one of my colleagues suggested it, and I was skeptical -- but now this niche device is my go-to tool when I feel like my head and eyes are ready to tap out.\nMy colleague, Allison Murray, owns the Eyeris 1 massager and finds it helpful for her headaches and migraines. She says it's an excellent gift for friends and family members. After her recommendation, I tried it for myself. I entered the experience with an open mind, but I'll admit I wasn't expecting to find much use for an eye massager, let alone that it would make a noticeable difference.\nAlso: These are the 5 weirdest wellness gadgets I never skip using - and how they work\nThe whole concept felt like a gimmick to me -- the kind of product you would see on early 2000s infomercials after you woke up on the couch at 2 a.m., somewhere between the ads for the Betty Crocker Bake 'n Fill pan and Tony Little's Gazelle.\nBut I was pleasantly surprised.\nThe Eyeris 2 is the upgraded massager from Renpho's Eyeris 1, but the concept is the same. It slips over your head and is secured with an elastic band, allowing you to customize your massage session with various settings. It integrates massage, compression, and vibration, which I find is a nice bonus, as it also skims your temples.\nAlso: I tested Soundcore's new sleep earbuds. Here's who I'd recommend them to (and who I wouldn't)\nThere are two adjustable compression intensity settings, as well as a heat option of 104 degrees or a toasting option of 113 degrees, to help alleviate eye puffiness, among other benefits. The heat settings on the Eyeris 2 are my favorite feature. It's like a big hug for your eyes wrapped in a heated blanket, and it makes a big difference in soothing away aches.\nThere's also Bluetooth, silent mode, and voice broadcast. I don't use these features much at all, but it's nice to have the option to turn on the speaker and stream your own music via the Eyeris 2.\nI was initially worried that I wouldn't be able to control the device effectively without being able to see, but it's been less of an issue than I thought.\nAlso: Why the AI wearable market is set to grow by 10x - and it's not just new gadgets\nThere are physical buttons for power/mode, compression, heat, and music/volume. Once you use the Eyeris a few times, it becomes easy, but the first few times I used it, I turned it on before placing it over my eyes. Just be sure to adjust the band first if you choose to go this route.\nIt also features a rechargeable battery that Renpho claims lasts approximately one week of moderate daily use. I don't use mine daily, but I don't find myself needing to charge very often, although that will depend on how long you use the device and how frequently.\nThe Renpho Eyeris 2 makes a uniquely fun gift for yourself or a loved one, and I also appreciate that it comes with its own storage bag to keep everything tidy and organized. It's certainly not an essential tech product, but if you love a whacky wellness gadget like me, it's a nice investment for your self-care.\nPlease note that Renpho instructs users to remove any eye accessories before use (eyeglasses, contact lenses, false eyelashes, etc). Renpho also advises against using the Eyeris 2 massager if you have undergone corrective myopia surgery or have eye conditions such as glaucoma, cataracts, etc. If you're unsure if an eye massager is safe for you, I recommend speaking with your optometrist or ophthalmologist before use.\nWhy I recommend this product\nI'm not saying you need to run out and buy this product. Perhaps it will be for you, and maybe it won't -- that's fine. I personally have enjoyed using this eye massager and find it helps with headaches, tired and swollen eyes, and more. For me, it's something extra I like to include as a part of my self-care routine, especially as a full-time WFH employee. Likely, this massager won't cure all your ailments or be some magic product. Still, I am a firm believer in owning tech items -- as whacky as they sometimes are -- that can help generate a better commitment to mental and physical wellness, and Renpho's eye massager does that for me.\nLooking for the next best product?
