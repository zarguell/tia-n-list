My top pick is the TOPGRO T1-Pro. This is the closest to a full-sized gaming PC that you can get, but in mini form. If expansion is your top priority, then the Minisforum MS-A1 is worth looking at. It has a removable processor, four M.2 slots, and an OCuLink port for external GPUs.\nThe best mini gaming PCs of 2025\nWhy we like it: The Topgro T1-Pro mini gaming PC has it all. It features a 13th-gen Intel Core i9-13900H processor, a high-performance GeForce RTX 4060 mobile graphics card, 64GB of fast DDR5-5200 RAM, and 2TB of M.2 NVMe storage. There's also Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet.\nThere's ample room for expansion with the system taking up to 64GB of RAM and 8TB of storage. All this hardware needs space to breathe, and the system is equipped with whisper-quiet fans when workload is low to full-on maximum cooling when needed.\nWho it's for: Someone who wants a small, stylish, and powerful mini gaming system need look no further than this.\nWho should look elsewhere: At a shade under $2,000, this is a serious system.

This mini gaming PC is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor, AMD Radeon GPU, 64GB of RAM, and a 2TB M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 SSD. In short, this is a system built on performance.\nThere are a few things that make this system stand out from the crowd. It features four M.2 slots for storage, so there's the ability to boost this with terabytes of storage capacity. There's also an OCuLink port to allow for an external GPU. Even the CPU is removable, so the system supports other AM5 chips.\nWho it's for: This is the mini PC for those who want a system that offers a lot of expansion possibilities for storage and even another processor and external GPU.\nWho should look elsewhere: You're paying for the expandability of this system, so if you don't need it, this is not the system for you.\nMinisforum MS-A2 tech specs: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor | AMD Radeon | 64GB RAM | 2TB M.2 2280 storage | USB-A and USB-C, 2.5 Ethernet and mic/headphone ports\nWhy we like it: This mini gaming PC has an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX+ processor, AMD Radeon 680M Graphics, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB M.2 NVMe PCIe3.0 SSD.

The side panel is held in place using magnetic latches, allowing access to the RAM slots supporting 64GB, the M.2 slow which supports 2TB, and space for a 2.5-inch SATA SSD up to 2TB.\nThe system features a control dial that allows the user to choose between three different performance settings, a handy touch because this way power consumption and noise can be kept to a minimum.\nWho it's for: Someone looking for a fun, stylish system with a lot of horsepower at a reasonable price.\nWho should look elsewhere: The \"unique\" style isn't for everyone.\nAcemagic Ryzen 9 6900HX+ tech specs: AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX+ | AMD Radeon 680M Graphics | 32GB DDR5 RAM | 1TB M.2 NVMe PCIe3.0 SSD | 4 x USB 3.2 Type-A and 1x USB 3.2 Type-C | Windows 11\nWhy we like it: The GMKtec Nucbox M7 Pro is built around the Intel Nuc's size -- a 7.6 x 7.4 x 4.9-inch box packed with high tech components. There's an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 6850H with built-in AMD Radeon 680M GPU. There's also 32GB of DDR5 RAM and a 2TB PCIe 3.0 M.2 2280 SSD.\nMultiple displays are no problem for this gaming PC, and it can support quad displays -- one over HDMI and DisplayPort, and two on the USB 4 ports.\nThere's also a built-in OCuLink port, a connector system that allows users to connect PCIe devices to a system using an external cable. This allows an external graphics card to be added, giving it a great deal of expandability -- up to 96GB of RAM and 4TB of storage.\nWho it's for: This is for people who want a functional, no-nonsense PC that packs a punch. No RGB lighting, no gimmicks, just a system that works.\nWho should look elsewhere: For some, that processor isn't going to offer enough horsepower.\nGMKtec Nucbox M7 Pro tech specs: AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 6850H | MD Radeon 680M GPU | 32GB DDR5 RAM | 2TB PCIe 3.0 M.2 2280 SSD | 2 x USB 3.2 Gen2 and 2 x USB 2.0 | Windows 11 Pro\nWhy we like it: Don't let the $299 price tag fool you into thinking this isn't a gaming PC. This device houses an AMD Ryzen 7 5700U with Radeon RX Vega8 Graphics,16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 512GB NVMe SSD.\nThe thing I really like about this mini gaming PC is that for the price you get a platform that you can expand on. If the base configuration isn't enough for you, you can easily add a second M.2 drive -- supporting a maximum of 4TB -- and bump the RAM up to 64GB.\nWho it's for: Those looking for a budget system that still delivers on performance.\nWho should look elsewhere: Those looking for more in terms of performance.\nAcemagician AMD Ryzen 7 5700U tech specs: AMD Zen3 Ryzen 7 Pro 5875U | AMD Radeon RX Vega8 | 16GB DDR4-2666 RAM | 512GB NVME M.2 SSD | 6 x USB 3 and 2 x USB-C | Windows 11 Pro\nWhat is the best mini gaming PC?\n*MSRP at the time of writing.\nWhich is the right mini gaming PC for you?\nChoose this mini gaming PC… | If you want… |\nTopgro T1-Pro | The best of the best.

If you are after a mini PC, then the mini part does come into play, so there is a size issue to bear in mind. The good news is that mini PCs come in a range of sizes, from systems that can fit in the palm of your hand to systems so small you could fit several of them in the palm of your hand.\n- Do you need a mini gaming PC? This is the top question when choosing a mini gaming PC. Do you actually need one, or would a full-size gaming PC be more apt for you?\n- Performance: Pretty standard PC consideration here. This is normally a case of more speed, more spend.\n- Budget: Small doesn't always mean cheap, but you can save money by choosing a mini PC that suits your needs.\n- Upgradability: How much upgradability do you want your mini gaming PC to have?\nHow did we choose these mini gaming PCs?\nThere are a lot of mini PCs on the market from a variety of different vendors, and I've tested and used mini gaming PCs from all the vendors listed here, I've based my selections on my experience using these brands as well as current model user reviews.\nProduct specs and price also come into play, but being able to draw on dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of other people's views allows me to get a broad sense of how well-received a selected mini gaming PC is. I've paid particular attention to reports of performance, stability, how quiet or noisy the PC is, and weeded out many that seemed to have a poor lifespan.\nWhat we're left with is the best of the best, in a broad selection of categories that are applicable to mini gaming PCs.\nLatest info on mini gaming PCs in 2025\nOctober 2025: Already hearing things from some of the big names in mini gaming PCs about some cool new product coming out in 2026. Stay tuned for mini PCs that can be upgraded, and some serious performance enhancements.\nFAQs on mini gaming PCs\nWhat is a mini gaming PC?\nA mini PC is a compact yet fully functional computer that offers many, if not all of, the capabilities of a desktop PC, but is packaged into a smaller size. Mini PCs are designed to save space and can be used for a variety of tasks, from basic computing to more demanding applications such as programming or even gaming.\nA mini gaming PC takes this one step further and is a system that's built with gaming in mind.\nWhat are the advantages of using a mini PC?\nPeople often choose to invest in a mini gaming PC for these reasons:\n- Space-saving: The top benefit of going for a mini gaming PC is that it takes up significantly less space than traditional desktop PCs.\n- Portable: Mini gaming PCs are lightweight and easy to move, making them ideal for users who need computing power on the go.\n- Energy efficiency: Most mini gaming PCs consume significantly less power than a similarly-specced desktop system, which can lead to cost savings on electricity.\n- Quiet: While a mini gaming PC isn't going to be fanless, these systems are far quieter than a standard desktop system.\nAre mini gaming PCs upgradeable?\nIt depends on the model. Most mini gaming PCs allow for easy upgrades to components like RAM and storage. There's also a system with an OCuLink port that allows the use of an external graphics card.\nLike laptops, mini PCs are better aimed at those situations where you buy the PC with the spec that you need rather than relying on an upgrade down the line. If you want the maximum upgradability possible, a regular desktop gaming PC might be better for you.\nWhat is OCuLink and why are there so many small mini PCs with this port?\nLatest Updates:\nOctober 2025: This month sees a few tweaks to the lineup. The Topgro T1-Pro and GMKtec Nucbox M7 Pro get some upgrades, the Minisforum MS-A1 joins the list as the most upgradable and expandable mini PC, and the Acemagician AMD Ryzen 7 5700U sees a big price cut.\nAlso added is an FAQ entry for OCuLink, which is the perfect way to boost performance of a mini PC, as well as a great dock to choose if you're looking to go down this route.\nOther products to consider\nIf your system has an Oculink SFF-8612 port, the RIITOP OCuLink eGPU docking station is the perfect way to add extra graphics horsepower to a system.
