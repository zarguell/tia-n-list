This is a laptop of extremes, pushing the boundaries of what a portable computer can be. Its hardware rivals that of top-tier gaming rigs, resulting in an unmatched level of power.\nAlso: I'd choose this Windows gaming PC over other pro laptops for work - here's why\nIt's not hyperbole when I say this is the most powerful laptop I've tested in 2025. That said, it does suffer from many of the same issues as other gaming laptops have: bulkiness, power-hungry components, and an expensive starting price. Do the pros outweigh the cons, ultimately? Let's take a look.\nBest laptop deals of the week\n- $630 (save $170)\nUnmatched power\nLet's start with performance, because this is where the Legion 9i outclasses the competition. My review unit housed an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card, and 64GB of RAM. It's an elite configuration delivering staggering power. Below is a table comparing the Legion 9i to other high-power gaming laptops. A few come close, but none overtake it.",
