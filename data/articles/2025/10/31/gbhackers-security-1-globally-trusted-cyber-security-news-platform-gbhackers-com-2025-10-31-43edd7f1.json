    "full": "Google has announced enhanced artificial intelligence protections designed to combat the rising tide of mobile scams affecting billions of users worldwide.\nThe company revealed that fraudsters stole over $400 billion globally in the past year using advanced AI-powered schemes, making mobile security more critical than ever.\nAndroid’s Advanced Defense Against Mobile Fraud\nGoogle’s Android platform now blocks more than 10 billion suspected malicious calls and messages every month through intelligent AI-driven protections.\nIn the most recent data, Google’s real-time security checks blocked over 100 million suspicious numbers attempting to abuse the RCS messaging service in just one month, preventing scammers from launching attacks before they could reach victims.\nThe new security features operate across multiple layers of protection. Google Messages automatically filters known spam by analyzing sender reputation and message content, while Scam Detection uses on-device artificial intelligence to identify conversational patterns associated with common fraud schemes, including “pig butchering” scams.\nPhone by Google similarly screens incoming calls automatically, blocking known spam before phones even ring.\nRecent research conducted by Google and YouGov surveyed 5,000 smartphone users across the United States, India, and Brazil to compare how well different platforms protect against scams. The findings revealed significant differences in user experience.\nAndroid users reported being 58% more likely than iOS users to receive zero scam texts within a week, while Pixel users showed even stronger results, with 96% higher likelihood of avoiding scam messages compared to iPhone owners.\nThe disparity became more pronounced at the extreme end. iOS users were 65% more likely than Android users to report receiving three or more scam texts weekly.\nWhen comparing iPhone specifically to Pixel devices, iPhone users were 136% more likely to experience heavy volumes of scam messages.\nAdditionally, Android users demonstrated greater confidence in their device’s security, with 20% more likely to describe their phone’s protections as “very effective” or “extremely effective.”\nCounterpoint Research evaluated the latest flagship devices from multiple manufacturers and concluded that Android smartphones provide comprehensive AI-powered protections across ten key security categories, including email protection, browsing safety, and behavioral analysis. By contrast, iOS provided AI protections in only two categories.\nLeviathan Security Group conducted similar testing on current-generation devices and ranked the Pixel 10 Pro as the highest performer for scam and fraud prevention.\nAnalysts particularly highlighted Android’s robust call screening capabilities and real-time scam detection as significant differentiators.\nGoogle emphasizes that Android’s protections continue evolving as threats become more sophisticated.\nThe company states that its multi-layered approach, combined with Google Play Protect scanning and enhanced Safe Browsing in Chrome, provides comprehensive security designed to keep users protected around the clock.\nFollow us on Google News, LinkedIn, and X to Get Instant Updates and Set GBH as a Preferred Source in Google.",
