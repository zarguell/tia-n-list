    "full": "Progress Software has released security patches to address a high-severity vulnerability in its MOVEit Transfer platform discovered on October 29, 2025.\nThe flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-10932, affects the AS2 module and allows attackers to consume system resources without proper restrictions.\n| Attribute | Details |\n| CVE ID | CVE-2025-10932 |\n| Vulnerability Type | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) |\n| Affected Component | Progress MOVEit Transfer AS2 Module |\n| CVSS Score | 8.2 (HIGH) |\nThis vulnerability puts thousands of enterprise organizations at risk, particularly those relying on MOVEit Transfer for secure file exchange and data management operations.\nThe vulnerability received a CVSS severity score of 8.2, categorizing it as a high-risk threat that requires immediate attention.\nUnlike some other critical flaws, this particular issue does not require authentication or user interaction, meaning attackers can exploit it remotely with minimal barriers to entry.\nProgress Software moved quickly to address the issue by releasing patched versions and implementing temporary protective measures for customers who cannot immediately update their systems.\nUnderstanding the Vulnerability and Its Impact\nThe uncontrolled resource consumption flaw impacts the AS2 module within MOVEit Transfer, a widely-used file transfer solution trusted by financial institutions, healthcare providers, and government agencies.\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker to send specially crafted requests that consume excessive server resources, potentially leading to service degradation or complete system unavailability.\nThis type of attack, known as a denial-of-service vulnerability, can disrupt critical business operations and interrupt important file transfer workflows.\nMultiple versions of MOVEit Transfer remain vulnerable to this attack. Progress has confirmed that versions ranging from 2025.0.0 through 2025.0.2, 2024.1.0 through 2024.1.6, and 2023.1.0 through 2023.1.15 all contain the flaw.\nOrganisations running any of these versions should treat this update as a priority security matter.\nProgress released patched versions that implement IP address whitelisting to protect the AS2 module from unauthorized access.\nOrganizations using MOVEit Transfer have two primary options depending on their operational requirements.\nCustomers with current maintenance agreements can download the fixed versions directly from the Progress Download Center using their credentials. These include MOVEit Transfer 2025.0.3, 2024.1.7, and 2023.1.16 for respective version branches.\nFor organizations unable to immediately deploy patches, Progress recommends temporarily disabling the AS2 module by removing specific files from the installation directory.\nThis interim solution protects systems while organizations plan their update schedules. Alternatively, administrators can add IP addresses of trusted AS2 trading partners to a whitelist, limiting exposure until patches are installed.\nProgress MOVEit Cloud customers require no action, as the company has already upgraded those cloud-hosted instances to the patched version. Organizations running on-premises installations must take active steps to secure their systems against this threat.\nFollow us on Google News, LinkedIn, and X to Get Instant Updates and Set GBH as a Preferred Source in Google.",
