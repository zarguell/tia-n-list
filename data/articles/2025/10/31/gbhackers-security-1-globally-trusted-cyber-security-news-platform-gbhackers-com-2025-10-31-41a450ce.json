    "full": "Sophos researchers have identified real-world exploitation of a newly disclosed vulnerability in Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), where threat actors are harvesting sensitive data from organizations worldwide.\nThe critical remote code execution flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-59287, has become a prime target for attackers seeking to breach enterprise networks and extract valuable information without authentication requirements.\nThe vulnerability gained immediate attention after Microsoft released patches on October 14, 2025, followed by an emergency out-of-band update on October 23.\nThe publication of proof-of-concept code on GitHub accelerated the exploitation timeline, with threat actors beginning attacks just hours after the technical analysis became public.\nSophos Counter Threat Unit researchers detected the first abuse of this flaw on October 24 at 02:53 UTC, marking the beginning of a coordinated wave of attacks targeting internet-facing WSUS servers across multiple industries.\nThe exploitation wave spanned several hours and impacted customers in technology, healthcare, manufacturing, and educational sectors, predominantly based in the United States.\nHow Attackers Exploit the Vulnerability\nThe attack methodology observed by Sophos security researchers demonstrates sophisticated capabilities.\nThreat actors leverage the deserialization bug to execute Base64-encoded PowerShell commands through nested cmd.exe processes running in IIS worker processes.\nOnce deployed, the malicious PowerShell script systematically harvests critical organizational data, including external IP addresses and port configurations, complete lists of Active Directory domain users, and detailed network interface configurations.\nThe harvested information is then exfiltrated to external webhook.site URLs under the threat actors’ control.\nResearchers identified at least six incidents across Sophos customer environments, though preliminary analysis suggests approximately 50 victims may have been compromised.\nWhen webhook.site upload attempts fail, the script automatically defaults to using the native curl command, ensuring successful data exfiltration regardless of initial connectivity issues.\nAnalysis of the public webhook.site URLs reveals sensitive dumps containing domain user information and network configurations from multiple universities, technology firms, manufacturing companies, and healthcare organizations.\nThe attackers’ choice to use free webhook.site services with visible request histories allowed researchers to document the full scope of exploitation activity.\nBetween October 24 at 02:53 UTC and 11:32 UTC, attackers hit the maximum 100-request limit on available webhook URLs, demonstrating the scale of reconnaissance activity targeting vulnerable systems.\nSecurity experts and government agencies, including CISA and NSA, urge organizations to immediately implement protective measures.\nThis includes applying available patches to all WSUS installations, identifying internet-exposed WSUS servers, and restricting access to WSUS ports 8530 and 8531 through network segmentation and firewall policies. Organisations should also review logs for indicators of scanning and exploitation attempts.\nThe rapid exploitation of CVE-2025-59287 demonstrates how quickly threat actors mobilize to abuse newly disclosed vulnerabilities, making timely patching and network segmentation essential for organizational security postures.\nFollow us on Google News, LinkedIn, and X to Get Instant Updates and Set GBH as a Preferred Source in Google.",
