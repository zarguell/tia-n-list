So in Labs now, you can opt into a new experiment for personalizing shopping and local recommendations for restaurants.”\nIt's unclear if Google plans to train its model on personal information, but this experience will be opt-in.\nSecrets Security Cheat Sheet: From Sprawl to Control\nWhether you're cleaning up old keys or setting guardrails for AI-generated code, this guide helps your team build securely from the start.\nGet the cheat sheet and take the guesswork out of secrets management.",
