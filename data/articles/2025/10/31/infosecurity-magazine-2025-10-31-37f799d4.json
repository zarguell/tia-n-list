    "raw": "A new UNC6384 campaign highlights the threat actor’s growing sophistication and geographic expansion",
    "full": "Researchers at Arctic Wolf Labs have discovered a cyber espionage campaign targeting European diplomatic entities in Hungary, Belgium and additional European nations.\nThe activity was observed in September and October 2025 and attributed to UNC6384, a cluster likely linked to Chinese-affiliated group Mustang Panda, also known as TEMP.Hex.\nThe campaign included refined social engineering leveraging authentic diplomatic conference themes as well as the exploitation of ZDI-CAN-25373, a Windows shortcut vulnerability disclosed in March 2025, said an Arctic Wolf report, published on October 30.\nThe threat actor deployed a multi-stage malware chain and involved the PlugX remote access trojan (RAT), a malicious payload typical of Chinese -affiliated threat actors.\nAttack Chain: Spear Phishing, Windows Exploit and PlugX RAT Deployment\nThe attack begins with targeted spear phishing emails themed around diplomatic meetings and conferences.\nThese spear phishing emails lead to the delivery of malicious LNK files, which exploit ZDI-CAN-25373, a Windows shortcut vulnerability that allows the threat actor to execute commands covertly by adding whitespace padding within the COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS structure.\nWhen executed, the LNK file invokes PowerShell with an obfuscated command that decodes a tar archive file named rjnlzlkfe.ta, which it saves it to the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. The PowerShell command then extracts the tar archive using tar.exe -xvf and initiates execution of the contained cnmpaui.exe file.\nIn parallel, each LNK file opened a decoy PDF document using diplomatic conference themes as lures, including Agenda_Meeting 26 Sep Brussels.lnk, which references a European Commission meeting on facilitating the free movement of goods at EU-Western Balkans border crossing points that was scheduled for September 26, 2025, in Brussels.\nThe extracted tar archive contains three critical files that enable the attack chain through DLL side-loading, a technique that abuses the Windows DLL search order to load malicious code through legitimate applications.\nThese include a legitimate Canon printer assistant utility that possesses a digital signature from Canon Inc., signed with a certificate issued by Symantec Class 3 SHA256 Code Signing CA. While the certificate has been expired since 2018, it is still recognized by Windows.\nThe second file, cnmpaui.dll, serves as a lightweight loader designed to decrypt and execute the third file in the archive, cnmplog.dat, which contains the encrypted PlugX payload.\nFirst observed in 2008, PlugX is a RAT that is actively deployed by Chinese-affiliated threat actors.\nThe malware provides comprehensive remote access capabilities including command execution, keylogging, file upload and download operations, persistence establishment and extensive system reconnaissance functions. Its modular architecture allows operators to extend functionality through plugin modules tailored to specific operational requirements.\nPlugX operates under multiple aliases including Korplug, TIGERPLUG and SOGU.\nUNC6384’s Growing Sophistication and Geographic Expansion\nUNC6384 is a Chinese-linked cyber espionage group identified by Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) in August 2025.\nThe threat group primarily targets diplomatic entities, initially focusing on Southeast Asia before expanding to European diplomats.\nIt uses sophisticated attack chains involving social engineering, traffic manipulation, signed malicious downloaders and memory-based malware to evade detection and achieve its goals.\nA key tool in UNC6384’s arsenal is PlugX, tracked by Google as SOGU.SEC when used by this group.\nGoogle assessed that UNC6384 is linked to Mustang Panda, a well-known China-aligned threat actor.\nBoth groups share targeting patterns (focus on government sectors) along with overlapping command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, PlugX variants and DLL side-loading techniques.\nIn this new malicious campaign detected by Arctic Wolf, targets included Hungarian and Belgian diplomats and potentially Serbian government officials. Arctic Wolf cited additional research by StrikeReady documenting the targeting of Serbian government aviation departments using lures themed around flight training plans for October 2025.\nArctic Wolf Labs researchers noted that this new UNC6384 campaign highlights the threat actor’s growing sophistication and geographic expansion in cyber espionage against diplomatic targets.\nThey emphasized that the group weaponized ZDI-CAN-25373 just six months after its disclosure, showing a \"sustained ability to integrate exploits into its tradecraft.\"\nThe shift from Southeast Asia to European diplomats suggests either \"broadened intelligence priorities\" or the deployment of new regional teams, while still relying on centrally developed tools.",
