You must enable it in settings.\nGoogle's earlier-than-expected release of Android 16 had a few important features missing at launch, but it did roll out with hardened security settings you shouldn't ignore.\nTo this day, arguably the most important change is Advanced Protection. It's a one-tap mode that enables Google's strongest security and privacy features. Instead of hunting through many menus to secure your phone, you now have a quick way to lock down your device and better protect yourself against theft, unsafe apps, insecure networks, scams, and spam.\nAlso: How to turn on Android's Private DNS mode - and why it makes such a big difference\nIt's like Google's version of Apple's Lockdown Mode. But it isn't turned on by default, since it enforces stricter safeguards that can occasionally cause friction. While there may be some trade-offs, Advanced Protection is for those who care about security and want to keep their phone ultra protected.\nHow to enable Advanced Protection\nWhat you'll need: Advanced Protection requires Android 16, so first make sure your device is up to date. Go to Settings > System > Software update (or System update on some devices), and then follow the prompts to install any updates. Android 16 is available now on supported Google Pixel phones, with other brands coming later this year.\n1. Open the Advanced Protection settings menu\nAdvanced Protection brings multiple security settings together in one place, but you'll need a screen lock set up before you can enable it. Once that's in place, go to Settings > Security and privacy on your Android 16 device.\n- Open Settings.\n- Tap Security and privacy.\n- Select Advanced Protection (you may find it under Other settings).\n2. Turn on Device protection\nAdvanced Protection is off by default on your Android device, so you'll need to switch it on to use it.\n- Under Advanced Protection, toggle on Device protection.\n- Select Turn on.\n- If prompted, restart your phone.\n3. Optional: Enroll your Google account\nOnce you turn on Advanced Protection on your Android device, you should enroll your Google account to further strengthen your security across Gmail, Drive, and other services. Once enrolled, signing in to your Google Account or related products will require a passkey or security key since these methods are more secure.\n- Go to Advanced Protection in your Google Account settings and sign in.\n- Follow the on-screen steps to enroll -- you may be asked to set up a passkey or security key, and to add a recovery phone and email.\n- Select Enroll to finish enrollment.\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy\nIf you ever want to unenroll your Google Account from Advanced Protection, go back to this screen (Google Account profile icon > Manage your Google Account > Security > Advanced Protection Program > Manage Advanced Protection) and select Unenroll.\nFAQs\nWhat is Advanced Protection on Android?\nAdvanced Protection in Android 16 combines multiple security settings across six categories into one switch. Turning it on will lock certain features so they can't be disabled individually, and it activates more protections.\nAlso: I unlocked hidden menus on my iPhone and Android with 14 secret codes\nHere's what it does, specifically, on your device, according to Google:\nApps\n- Google Play Protect: Always-on malware scanning that cannot be turned off.\n- Unknown apps: Blocks installs from outside Google Play, including sideloading.\n- Memory Tagging Extension (MTE): On supported devices, automatically enabled to stop memory corruption.\nDevice safety\n- Theft detection lock: Locks your phone after a suspicious motion.\n- Offline device lock: Locks automatically when the phone goes offline.\n- Inactivity reboot: Reboots after 72 hours locked.\nMessages\n- Spam and scam protection: Filters and flags harmful texts.\n- Unsafe links: Warns about suspicious links from unknown senders.\nNetwork\n- 2G network protection: Prevents your phone from connecting to insecure 2G networks (on supported devices).\nPhone\n- Caller ID and spam: Identifies suspect calls before you answer.\n- Automatic Call Screen: In supported regions, Google's AI screens and declines spam calls automatically.\nWeb\n- Safe browsing: Blocks phishing and malicious websites.\n- Chrome HTTPS enforcement: Forces HTTPS whenever possible.\n- JavaScript protections: Disables Chrome's JavaScript optimizer to reduce attack risks.\nWhy isn't Advanced Protection enabled by default?\nSome aspects, such as blocking sideloaded apps or automatically screening calls, may cause issues for certain users. So, it's optional, even though it offers stronger security.\nDoes Advanced Protection block sideloaded apps?\nYes. It blocks installations from unknown sources -- so you can't sideload apps outside the Play Store while it's enabled.\nWill Advanced Protection slow down my phone or make it harder to use?\nYou won't notice much difference. The biggest trade-offs are losing the ability to sideload apps and occasional issues with spam and call screening.\nWhat exactly happens if my phone is stolen?\nIf your phone is stolen, Advanced Protection is helpful. It includes Theft Detection Lock, which automatically locks your phone if it's grabbed from your hand or moved suddenly. It also has Offline Device Lock, which locks the device when it loses connection, and Inactivity Reboot, which forces a reboot if the phone stays locked for 72 hours.\nDo I need Google Account Advanced Protection?\nSeparate from the device toggle, Google Account Advanced Protection secures your online account (Gmail, Drive, Docs, and more).\nAlso: The best secure browsers for privacy in 2025: Expert tested\nIt's an opt-in program that requires stronger sign-in methods, such as passkeys or physical security keys, and limits third-party access to your data. Unlike Android's Advanced Protection, which focuses on your phone and local data, this program protects your online account and data in the cloud. For the highest level of security, especially if you're at high risk, both are worth enabling.",
