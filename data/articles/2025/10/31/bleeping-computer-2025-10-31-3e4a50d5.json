    "full": "If you have two headphones, speakers, or any other Bluetooth hardware, you can now share audio between the two devices simultaneously on a Copilot+ PC.\nMicrosoft is testing a new feature called \"shared audio,\" which is built on top of Bluetooth LE Audio broadcast technology.\nWith Bluetooth LE Audio broadcast technology, Windows can now transmit an audio stream to two Bluetooth devices.\nRight now, if you have a Bluetooth speaker and an earbud, you can connect only one of them. Even if you manage to connect the two devices, you cannot play audio through both at the same time.\nThis is a limitation of Bluetooth, but newer modems include support for Bluetooth LE Audio broadcast technology.\nModern PCs, particularly Copilot+ PCs, have this technology, and Microsoft is finally adding support for shared audio to Windows 11.\n\"Shared audio lets students share music with a friend while studying or brings family members closer by watching a movie together on an airplane,\" Microsoft noted.\nIn Windows 11 Build 26220.7051 (KB5067115), you can turn on the new “Shared audio (preview)” shortcut in quick settings to start sharing audio.\nOnce you're sharing the audio, you need to use “Stop sharing” to end the sharing session.\nMicrosoft says support for more devices will be added later, but for now, only these PCs support the shared audio feature:\n- Surface Laptop, 13.8-inch and 15-inch* | Qualcomm Snapdragon X\n- Surface Laptop for Business, 13.8 and 15-inch* | Qualcomm Snapdragon X\n- Surface Pro, 13-inch** | Qualcomm Snapdragon X\n- Surface Pro for Business, 13-inch** | Qualcomm Snapdragon X\nComing soon:\n- Samsung Galaxy Book5 360 | Intel Core Ultra Series 200\n- Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro | Intel Core Ultra Series 200\n- Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 | Intel Core Ultra Series 200\n- Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge | Qualcomm Snapdragon X\n- Surface Laptop, 13-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon X\n- Surface Laptop for Business, 13-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon X\n- Surface Pro, 12-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon X\n- Surface Pro for Business, 12-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon X\nRemember that you'll also need a supported audio accessory.\nMost Bluetooth devices support Shared audio, such as Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Buds3, and Buds3 Pro.\nThis feature is rolling out to everyone in the Windows Insider Program's Dev and Beta channel with Windows 11 Build 26220.7051 (KB5067115).",
