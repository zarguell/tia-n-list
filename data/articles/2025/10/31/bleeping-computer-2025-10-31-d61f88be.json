    "full": "The Australian government is warning about ongoing cyberattacks against unpatched Cisco IOS XE devices in the country to infect routers with the BadCandy webshell.\nThe vulnerability exploited in these attacks is CVE-2023-20198, a max-severity flaw that allows remote unauthenticated threat actors to create a local admin user via the web user interface and take over the devices.\nCisco fixed the flaw in October 2023, which was then marked as an actively exploited issue. A public exploit became available two weeks later, fueling mass exploitation for backdoor planting on internet-exposed devices.\nThe Australian authorities have warned that variants of the same Lua-based BadCandy web shells are still used in attacks throughout 2024 and 2025, indicating that many Cisco devices remain unpatched.\nOnce installed, BadCandy allows remote attackers to execute commands with root privileges on compromised devices.\nThe webshell is wiped from the devices upon reboot. However, given the lack of a patch on those devices and assuming the web interface remains accessible, the attackers can easily re-introduce it.\n\"Since July 2025, ASD assesses over 400 devices were potentially compromised with BADCANDY in Australia,\" reads the bulletin. \"As at late October 2025, there are still over 150 devices compromised with BADCANDY in Australia.\"\nAlthough the number of infections is declining, the agency has seen signs of re-exploitation of the flaw against the same endpoints, even though the breach entities were appropriately alerted.\nAccording to the agency, the attackers can detect when the BadCandy implant gets removed and target the same device to re-introduce it.\nIn response to the ongoing attacks, the Australian Signals Directorate is sending notifications to victims that include instructions on patching, hardening devices, and conducting incident response. For devices whose owners cannot be determined, the ASD is asking internet service providers to contact victims on their behalf.\nThe ASD mentions that the flaw has been previously leveraged by state actors such as the Chinese' Salt Typhoon,' who are considered responsible for a series of attacks against large telecommunication service providers across the U.S. and Canada.\nThe agency believes that, even though BadCandy can theoretically be used by anyone, the recent spikes can be attributed to \"state-sponsored cyber-actors.\"\nAdministrators of Cisco IOS XE systems worldwide, including in Australia, should follow the vendor's mitigation recommendations in the security bulletin.\nCisco has also published a detailed hardening guide for IOS XE devices.\nThe 2026 CISO Budget Benchmark\nIt's budget season! Over 300 CISOs and security leaders have shared how they're planning, spending, and prioritizing for the year ahead. This report compiles their insights, allowing readers to benchmark strategies, identify emerging trends, and compare their priorities as they head into 2026.\nLearn how top leaders are turning investment into measurable impact.",
