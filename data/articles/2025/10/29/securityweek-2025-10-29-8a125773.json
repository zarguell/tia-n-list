    "full": "Polygraf AI announced on Tuesday that it has raised $9.5 million in a seed funding round that will enable it to enhance its AI security solutions.\nThe funding round was led by Allegis Capital, with participation from Alumni Ventures, DataPower VC, Domino Ventures and others. In addition to enabling Polygraf AI to improve its product, the new investment will be used for go-to-market efforts.\nThe startup has developed proprietary small language model (SLM) technology designed to help organizations detect and mitigate AI risks.\nSpecifically, the platform aims to facilitate safe AI adoption by preventing the leakage of personal and proprietary information, by detecting AI-generated or manipulated content, and by helping maintain compliance with GDPR, HIPAA and other regulations.\nFor instance, Polygraf AI can detect when personal or confidential information is exposed by employees in a chat with an AI model. It can also scan files and folders for data that may be inadvertently exposed due to the use of AI tools for content management.\nThe solution can also redact sensitive data in documents, and authenticate prompts and calls with a provenance layer to prevent deepfake fraud.\n“The world is realizing that large, cloud-trained models come with large, unpredictable risks,” said Yagub Rahimov, co-founder and CEO of Polygraf AI.\nRahimov added, “At Polygraf, we are on a mission to eliminate those risks. We’re proving that you can have both intelligence and integrity—a private AI for sensitive missions that is small, local, explainable, and trustworthy. This funding enables us to double down on our vision to protect the world’s most critical operations, where failure simply isn’t an option.”\nRelated: OpenAI Atlas Omnibox Is Vulnerable to Jailbreaks\nRelated: Sublime Security Raises $150 Million for Email Security Platform\nRelated: Chainguard Raises $280 Million in Growth Funding\nRelated: SimSpace Raises $39 Million for Cyber Range Platform",
