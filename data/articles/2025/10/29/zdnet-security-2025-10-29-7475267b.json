An option called God Mode eases the process by providing a gateway to all the core options on one screen.\nBy setting up the special God Mode folder, you can view the settings for Backup and Restore, Color Management, Devices and Printers, Ease of Access, File History, Mouse, Power Options, Programs and Features, Security and Maintenance, Speech Recognition, Troubleshooting, User Accounts, and much more.\nAlso: How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - 2 free options\nGod Mode is especially useful for advanced Windows users and developers who like to manage and tweak all the nitty-gritty details of Windows. But it can also prove helpful to anyone who wants an array of commands available in one place. Since Microsoft no longer offers a Start menu shortcut for Control Panel, God Mode can be a quick and easy way to access all its core features and applets.\nThe process for setting up God Mode is the same in Windows 10 and 11, but here I'm focusing on Windows 11. Now, let's see how this works.\nHow to set up God Mode in Windows 11\n1. Check your account\nFirst, make sure you're signed into your Windows 11 PC with an account that has administrative privileges. By default, your own account should have the necessary rights. To confirm this, go to Settings, select the category for Accounts, and then check your account to make sure it's designated as Administrator.\nAlso: Microsoft said my PC was 'too old' to run Windows 11 - how I upgraded in 5 minutes anyway\n2. Create a new folder\nNext, right-click on any empty area of the desktop. In the pop-up menu, move to New, and select the command for Folder.\n3. Rename the new folder\nRight-click on the new folder and rename it to the following string:\nGodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}\nAlso: How to screen record in Windows 10 or 11 with built-in tools\nWhen done, press Enter.\n4. Launch the God Mode window\nDouble-click the icon, and a window opens with all the available settings. The commands are organized by Control Panel applet, so you can browse through the various categories, including Backup and Restore, Devices and Printers, File History, Mouse, Programs and Features, Security and Maintenance, Troubleshooting, and User Accounts.\n5. Search for a command\nAlternatively, you can search for a specific command or applet in the God Mode window. Just type the keyword or term in the search field to view the related results.\nAlso: I tested all of Edge's new AI browser features - and it felt like having a personal assistant\n6. Double-click the command to launch it\nWhen you see the setting or command you want, simply double-click it to launch it.\n7. Create a changeable icon for God Mode\nBy setting up God Mode with the usual steps, you can't see the icon's name or change the image. But here's a way to create an icon with a viewable name and modifiable image.\nAlso: Your complete Windows 11 upgrade guide: Everything to know - before you ditch Windows 10\nAt the window for New, choose the option for Shortcut instead of Folder. In the field for \"Type the location of the item,\" enter the following string:\nexplorer shell:::{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}\nWhen done, click Next.\n8. Name the shortcut\nAt the next screen, you can enter any name you wish for the shortcut. Click Finish.\n9. Change the icon\nTo change the icon from the generic folder image, right-click on it and select Properties. Click the \"Change icon\" button, and you can select a different icon from the explorer.exe file. You can also search for other executable files with built-in icons and choose the one you like. When done, click OK in the Properties window.\nAlso: Windows 11 upgrade not working? Try my 4 favorite troubleshooting tricks\n10.
