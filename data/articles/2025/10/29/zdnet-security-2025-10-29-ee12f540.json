We gather data from the best available sources, including vendor and retailer listings as well as other relevant and independent reviews sites. And we pore over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the products and services weâ€™re assessing.\nWhen you click through from our site to a retailer and buy a product or service, we may earn affiliate commissions. This helps support our work, but does not affect what we cover or how, and it does not affect the price you pay. Neither ZDNET nor the author are compensated for these independent reviews. Indeed, we follow strict guidelines that ensure our editorial content is never influenced by advertisers.\nZDNET's editorial team writes on behalf of you, our reader. Our goal is to deliver the most accurate information and the most knowledgeable advice possible in order to help you make smarter buying decisions on tech gear and a wide array of products and services. Our editors thoroughly review and fact-check every article to ensure that our content meets the highest standards. If we have made an error or published misleading information, we will correct or clarify the article. If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nTraditional cable used to be the gold standard, but everything changed when online content providers adopted subscription packages like Netflix and Hulu. Costs skyrocketed for consumers who wanted access to a swath of TV shows and live events.\nWith so many separate live services available, some of us have been tempted to finally cut the cord and sign up for live news, sports, and shows instead. These can be available for a fraction of the cost of traditional cable. There's another benefit: Live TV streaming services don't require any additional equipment or lengthy setup phone calls. You can also watch live programs from your TV, phone, laptop, or tablet.\nAlso: The best TV antennas: Expert tested\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nWhat is the best live TV streaming service right now?\nMy pick for the best overall live TV streaming service is YouTube TV due to its wide channel selection, unlimited DVR, and add-on options for more channels and networks. (A tip: To see the full list of live channels that each service offers, click through to their website and enter your zip code.) It's expensive, so another of my top choices is Philo at only $33 per month.\nI've been testing streaming services for both our sister site CNET and ZDNET. I've kept a close eye on the market for years and I considered the results of hands-on testing, alongside customer reviews, while creating my recommendations list.\nRead on to find the rest of my picks for the best live TV streaming services.\nBest live TV streaming services of 2025\nYouTube TV is my pick for the overall best live TV streaming service due to its unlimited DVR and more than 100 channels including AMC, FX, NBA TV, Disney Channel, and Nickelodeon.\nWhy we like it: My family subscribes to YouTube TV largely because it's the only streaming service that offers NFL Sunday Ticket -- a package for watching out-of-market Sunday afternoon football games for an additional cost. This add-on is the one to consider for every football fan gearing up for next season.\nWith the multiview feature, you can watch up to four channels on the same screen, so you'll never miss a game, even if two are scheduled simultaneously.\nYou can tack on Max, Starz, Showtime, and more sports networks for an extra fee. For an additional $10 a month, you can add 4K viewing to certain content, enjoy unlimited simultaneous streams at home, and watch recorded content offline.\nWho it's for: If you're looking for the widest selection of channels -- and/or NFL Sunday ticket -- and don't mind the price tag, YouTube TV is an excellent live TV streaming service.\nAhead of Black Friday, the company is offering this service at $73 per month for the first three months.\nWho should look elsewhere: The biggest downside is the price, which recently jumped from $73 to $83 a month. Even at its current sales price, it is expensive. In comparison, Hulu (With Ads) + Live TV costs the same and also includes access to Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+.\nYouTube TV features: Channels: 100+ | Plan options: 1 | Video storage: Unlimited | Price: Starts at $83 per month ($73 per month on sale)\nIf you're on a budget, Sling TV is my pick for the best TV streaming service with affordable options to tailor the service to the channels you actually watch.\nWhy we like it: Sling TV offers two major plans. Orange is $5 per day and offers channels like Disney Channel and ESPN. Blue costs $46 a month and offers local channels including ABC, Fox, and NBC, as well as other premium cable channels like FX, Bravo, NFL Network, and FS1.\nBoth plans include 25 base channels like AMC, CNN, Comedy Central, TBS, and TNT. You can also combine them for just $61 a month. For further savings, you can get half off your first month of any plan when you sign up, and add on premium channels like Showtime, Starz, AMC+, and MGM+ for additional monthly fees.\nThere is also a slimline package available for $20 per month including channels like the NFL Network.\nIf you're looking for international channels, Sling TV has more options than any other service including numerous Asian, European, Arabic, Brazilian, and Portuguese language options.\nWho it's for: If you're looking for a basic and affordable live TV streaming service that still gets you a good number of channels and an easy-to-use interface -- and you're not deterred by antennas -- Sling TV is a great choice.\nWho should look elsewhere: Sling TV falls short when compared to other services' DVR offerings -- it only includes 50 hours of DVR storage unless you pay extra. It also doesn't come with many local channels, though the platform suggests adding on an antenna -- which you'll have to buy if you don't already have one.\nSling TV features: Channels: 30+ | Plan options: 3 | Video storage: 50 hours | Price: Starts at $20 per month\nDirecTV Stream is the live TV streaming service that most resembles cable, both in terms of the user experience and the price tag.\nWhy we like it: DirecTV Stream lets you keep the nostalgic channel-flipping experience with the ability to swipe left and right on your phone to change channels.\nDirecTV Stream also offers unlimited in-home streams, three maximum out-of-home streams, and unlimited DVR storage.\nWho it's for: Anyone who wants to cut the cord without losing the traditional cable experience.\nThe Entertainment plan costs $90 a month for more than 90 channels, the Choice plan costs $95 a month for more than 125 channels, and the Ultimate plan costs $125 a month for more than 160 channels.\nAt the time of publication, DirecTV's Entertainment, Choice, and Ultimate plans are on sale for $50, $60, and $90 per month, respectively. However, prices jump after the first month.\nYou can also add on a sports pack to each of these plans for an extra $15 a month, which includes ESPN, NFL Network, MLB Network, and more regional sports networks than many others on this list.\nWho should look elsewhere: This service is quite expensive outside of sales events, and so if you want something cheaper, check out my other recommendations.\nDirecTV Stream features: Channels: 75+ | Plan options: 3 | Video storage: Unlimited | Price: Starts at $87 per month\nIf watching live sports is your main draw for a live TV streaming service, FuboTV is the best choice for you.\nWhy we like it: Watch ESPN, BeIN Sports, the Big 10, FS1, FS2, and the Golf Channel in addition to most local networks, including ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox. With this package, you can access everything from NFL, NBA, and MLB games to English Premier League soccer games, NASCAR races, boxing, and more.\nCheck FuboTV's website below to see what specific local channels are available for your zip code.\nBeyond sports, FuboTV also includes live channels like FX, Bravo, E!, HGTV, Food Network, Disney Channel, Hallmark, Fox, and MSNBC. Add on Starz, Showtime, or MGM+ for additional monthly fees. With 1,000 hours of DVR storage, you're not likely to run out of space for a while, and you can stream on up to three devices simultaneously.\nWho it's for: This is an ideal live TV streaming service for sports fans.\nChoose from three different plan tiers ranging from $56 to $105 per month outside of promotional pricing. However, you can take advantage of a one-month discount, cutting the price to $46 - $75.\nAll plans offer local ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC channels in many regions. However, FuboTV doesn't include TNT and TBS, both of which show a lot of sports. It also doesn't include the Fox regional sports networks, and if you want to watch league-specific channels -- like MLB TV or NHL Network -- you'll have to upgrade or expand your plan.\nA free trial is available.\nWho should look elsewhere: There's plenty of storage and channel options, but if sports aren't your priority, shop around.\nFuboTV features: Channels: 175+ | Plan options: 3 | Video storage: 1,000 hours | Price: Starts at $56 per month\nPhilo is a great option if you're looking for a cheaper live TV streaming option and aren't super interested in sports or local programming.\nWhy we like it: At just $33 a month, you can stream more than 70 live channels and 100 free channels and access an on-demand library of over 70,000 titles.\nPhilo's live TV channels include Comedy Central, HGTV, AMC, Discovery, TLC, Discovery, BET, Nickelodeon, Lifetime, and Food Network. AMC+ is now built into Philo's core package, giving access to that platform's premium shows and movies.\nA major plus -- Philo offers unlimited DVR, so you can rewind and fast forward through commercials on your recorded programming. Even without the DVR, most of the platform's shows and movies remain available on demand for a few days after their first live airing.\nStream on up to three devices at once and create up to 10 user profiles. If you do want to try to access some local channels and sports, you can supplement Philo with a TV antenna.\nWho it's for: Anyone who wants an affordable live TV service. You can also take advantage of a number of free channels before taking the plunge.\nWho should look elsewhere: It's cheap, has plenty of channels, and generous storage options -- but you might want to explore our other favorites if you are focused on local or sports TV.\nPhilo features: Channels: 170+ | Plan options: 1 | Video storage: Unlimited | Price: Starts at $33 per month\nWhich live TV streaming service is right for you?\n| If you want... | Then choose... |\n| The best live TV streaming service overall | YouTube TV, with over 100 channels and unlimited DVR.

Enter your zip code on their websites to find out more about what's available for you.\n- Price: Since many people looking to cut the cord are aiming to save money, you'll want to consider how much you'll be spending each month on a live TV streaming service -- especially if you're already subscribed to other VoD streaming services like Netflix.\n- Channel options: While most of the live TV streaming services on this list include similar cable channels, some don't include local channels, others don't include sports channels, and all require additional fees to access premium cable channels like Max, Starz, and Showtime. You'll want to consider what shows you want access to when choosing a service.\n- DVR storage: All of the live TV streaming services on this list include some form of digital video recording (DVR) storage, so you can record live shows to watch at your convenience (and fast forward through commercials). However, they range widely, from just 50 hours of storage to unlimited storage.\n- User experience: If you're making the switch from cable, you'll want to have a user-friendly live TV streaming service that's easy to navigate. Many of these services offer free trials, so if you're interested in testing them out, you can.\nHow we test live TV streaming services\nI've spent hours testing and researching the live TV streaming services on this list, as well as other VoD streaming services over the years. When testing a streaming service, I typically subscribe to a free trial, and spend time using it over several days. When choosing my top streaming services picks, I consider the channel options (including whether the services include local, sports, or premium channels), features (like DVR storage and multiple stream options), the design and user experience of the service (including how easy it is to navigate), and finally the value (the price compared to the rest of these factors).\nLatest news\n- Fubo shareholders approved a plan to merge with Disney's Hulu + Live TV business.\n- Roku's acquisition of Frndly TV could mean subscribers lose access to the Hallmark channel and its sister networks.\n- With the debut of Amazon's new Fire TV Stick 4K Select, its operating system -- Vega OS -- will prevent sideloading, a measure to combat piracy and illegal streaming.\nFAQs on live TV streaming services\nWhat is the best live TV streaming service for sports?\nThe best live TV streaming service is FuboTV, which features both mainstream sports like football and hockey and non-mainstream sports like F1 racing and cricket. There are also several sports channel add-ons to choose from, including an NBA League Pass channel and International Sports Plus, so you'll find something for every sports fan.\nWhich is the best streaming service for NFL?\nThere are a number of different streaming services that you can use to watch NFL games, but they can vary considerably in their coverage types. For example, YouTube TV is where you'll find NFL Sunday Ticket, which lets you watch all out-of-market games. The NFL Plus streaming service also includes RedZone and the NFL network, though you'll only be able to watch local and primetime games on your phone, not your TV or computer. For more, check out our guide for how to watch NFL games live.\nWhat live TV streaming service has the best picture quality?\nYouTube TV and Hulu Plus Live TV support 1080p/60fps live streams on select platforms, so if picture quality is something that's important to you, these are both good options.\nIs streaming cheaper than cable?\nShort answer: It depends. When people first started cutting the cord over a decade ago, it was possible to save over $100 per month and still get to watch the shows you wanted. But today, internet streaming service bills have crept up closer to cable TV levels. However, if you're savvy about which services you subscribe to -- and if you can share subscriptions at times -- it's still possible to save.\nWhat live stream service is the best substitute for cable?\nThe live TV streaming services on this list all have something to offer. While YouTube TV is my top pick generally, if you're looking for the closest thing to cable in terms of number of channels and user experience, I'd say go for DirecTV Stream.\nWhat is the cheapest live TV streaming service?\nThe cheapest live TV streaming service is Philo TV which carries more than 115 channels, and includes A&E, Discovery Channel, Comedy Central, and more, for just $25 per month.\nWhich streaming services offer live TV?\nOf the bigger streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video are the only two that offer any kind of live TV streaming at the moment. Hulu has a partnership with ESPN+, meaning that certain live sports events can be streamed through the basic Hulu plan without any additional cost. Amazon Prime Video has rights to Thursday Night NFL games, which allows Prime members to stream live football games from the Prime Video app.\nDo you need fast internet to stream live TV?\nTo make use of any of these services, you'll need broadband internet. If you're living on your own, you may be able to get by with as little as 10Mbp. If you're sharing your home with others and/or you want to watch 4K videos, we recommend you have at least a 25Mbps internet connection. Not sure how fast your connection is? Run the Ookla Speedtest.\nAnd, by the way, you won't lose anything by switching from a cable box to a Roku or Amazon Fire TV 4K stick. The only real difference between conventional cable and internet TV is that live streaming sports lag 15 seconds to a minute behind live broadcasts.\nWhich streaming device should you use?\nFor the most part, all of these support the most popular streaming devices. For example, no matter which service you subscribe to, an Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV Cube, Roku Express, or Google Chromecast will almost certainly support it. But if you're using a more obscure streaming gadget, such as an Nvidia Shield TV Pro, it might not work with your preferred service. Smart TVs also frequently don't support newer streaming offerings. In short, make sure the service will work with your hardware before subscribing.\nLatest updates\n- October 2025: In ZDNET's October update, we performed substantial editorial changes and updated the pricing and deals for each of our favorite services.\nOther live TV streaming services we've tested\nIf you're looking for a source for NBC content, Peacock is a great option. This content provider has live TV, with 24/7 broadcasts of popular NBC shows. Its Premium Plus tier includes live TV from all local NBC stations. Plans start at $8 per month.\nParamount Global's Pluto TV has more than 250 channels of free live TV and thousands of on-demand movies and TV shows. Paramount movies and TV shows are your best option here, and shows can be watched live, online.\nJust choose your local station to start streaming PBS live for free. You can take a look at the full day's schedule in advance to see the lineup. The layout is clean and easy to understand, and the video quality is reasonable.\nWe hope that you have found our guide to the best live TV streaming services useful.
