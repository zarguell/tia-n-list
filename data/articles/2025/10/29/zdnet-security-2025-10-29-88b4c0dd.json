We gather data from the best available sources, including vendor and retailer listings as well as other relevant and independent reviews sites.

They can change your IP address location, layer encryption to disguise your online activities, and often come with additional security features, such as password managers and data breach alert systems.\nAlso: The best VPN services we've tested\nIf you're interested in trying out a VPN, now is the perfect time, as many subscriptions hit their lowest price of the year. I've reviewed and tested VPNs for years, and kept a close watch on prices and subscription changes, and so the deals I've listed below are worth your time.\nI will be updating my Black Friday VPN deal recommendations as more VPN providers launch their own sales. To find the best deals so far, check out my favorites below.\nBest early Black Friday VPN deals\n- Current price: $2.19 (combination package)\n- Original price: $2.49\nSurfshark is one of the most consistently affordable VPN services around, with its basic package currently on sale for only $1.99/month on a two-year contract. However, my favorite deal is one tier above, Surfshark One, now priced at $2.19/month. What makes this deal great is the antivirus add-on, which costs only $0.20 extra per month.\nTo sweeten the deal, you are also given three months of free access.\nReview: Surfshark VPN review: One of our favorite budget VPNs with unlimited connections\n- Current price: $2.99 ($2.89 for existing customers)\n- Original price: $3.49\nAnother great deal is for NordVPN, one of the fastest VPNs around with a large server network and robust security. This VPN is one of ZDNET's favorites, especially for travel and streaming, and is typically priced at around $3.49/month.\nHowever, NordVPN launched its Black Friday sale early this year, and you can now pay only $2.99/month on a two-year contract. Existing customers can also take advantage of this plan for $2.89/month.\nReview: Why I still recommend NordVPN to most people in 2025 - especially with the latest update\n- Current price: $2.99\n- Original price: $3.49 (approximately)\nWe've also spotted a fair deal ahead of Black Friday for Proton VPN. If security is your top priority, consider this VPN -- especially now that it's available for only $2.99/month on a two-year contract. If you would prefer to try out this VPN for only one year, you can also opt to pay $3.99/month.\nProton VPN also offers a free plan, which we recommend, though it is very limited and you likely won't enjoy the same speeds as paid subscribers.\nReview: Proton VPN review: A very solid free VPN with robust leak protection\n- Current price: $2.19 (additional perks)\n- Original price: $2.19\nIPVanish is a reasonably fast VPN with a strong server network. While the price of this VPN, $2.19/month, has not changed on its two-year plans (yet), IPVanish's early Black Friday deal is focused on perks. If you choose a two-year contract, you will be given 2TB of cloud storage and 10GB of free eSIM data.\nReview: IPVanish VPN review: Why it earned a spot in my favorites list\n- Current price: $4.17/month (54% off)\n- Original price: $9.10/month (approximately)\nNorton VPN is also on sale ahead of Black Friday. We particularly like the look of Norton's VPN Plus plan, now available with a 54% discount. This bundle comes with a VPN, alongside an ad blocker, scam detection, password manager, and 10GB of cloud storage.\nMore early Black Friday VPN deals\n- CyberGhost: $2.19/month (two months free): I hope to see a price drop closer to Black Friday, but for now, you can opt for a two-year plan at $2.19/month with two months of free access added to the length of your contract.\n- ExpressVPN: $3.49/month (four months free): This price drop for a two-year contract, once priced at over $5/month, is the result of ExpressVPN's recent shift to a tiered plan system. While it's not a Black Friday deal, it's still great value for a fast and secure VPN.\n- Private Internet Access: $2.19 (two months free): PIA tends to flit between different contract terms on a whim, including 6-month, one-year, two-year, and three-year contracts. But for now, you can sign up for a two-year plan with two months free for $2.19/month.\n- Privado VPN: $1.11/month (three months free): Privado VPN is a consistently cheap VPN service, and right now, you will only pay $1.11/month on a two-year contract.\n- Pure VPN: $1.69/month: Another cheap VPN service is Pure VPN, and it is worth considering if you want a set-and-forget VPN for the long term. You can save on a five-year contract.\nFAQs\nWhen is Black Friday?\nBlack Friday used to just be on the last Friday of November each year. However, many retailers now offer their own sales over the course of a full week, and so you can expect sales to appear from around Monday, Nov. 24. Black Friday itself lands on Friday, Nov. 28, and leads up to Cyber Monday on Dec. 1.\nAre VPNs really cheaper during Black Friday?\nYes, they can be. Or, at least, you will find upgraded services available for the same price that are only around during promotional events. The closer we get to Black Friday, the more likely VPN deals are to appear -- especially as rival companies compete for your attention. You'll be able to pick up a solid, secure VPN for as little as a few dollars per month.\nHow did we choose these early Black Friday deals?\nZDNET only writes about deals that capture our own interest -- devices and products we want, need, or would recommend not only to our readers, but to friends and family. Our experts look for deals at least 20% off (or hardly ever on sale), using established price-comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually worth your time.\nWe also examine customer reviews and rely on our own hands-on experience with new tech to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the products we're recommending. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice and to make you aware of price drops so you can shop smarter.",
