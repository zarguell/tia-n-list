    "raw": "A rise in attacks on PHP servers, IoT devices and cloud gateways is linked to botnets exploiting flaws, according to new research published by Qualys",
    "full": "A sharp increase in attacks targeting PHP servers, internet of things (IoT) devices and cloud gateways has been identified by cybersecurity researchers.\nThe latest report by the Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU), published today, attributes the rise to botnets such as Mirai, Gafgyt and Mozi, which are exploiting known CVEs and cloud misconfigurations to expand their reach.\nWith PHP powering over 73% of websites and 82% of enterprises reporting incidents linked to cloud misconfigurations, the digital attack surface continues to grow. This makes servers running PHP-based applications, such as WordPress, especially attractive to attackers seeking remote code execution (RCE) or data theft opportunities.\n“Routers and IoT devices have long been targeted and compromised to form increasingly large botnets,” said James Maude, field CTO at BeyondTrust.\n“Almost a decade ago, we saw the rise of the Mirai botnet, which initially abused 60 default usernames and passwords to log into and infect a huge number of devices.”\nHe added that while history doesn’t repeat itself, “it often rhymes when it comes to router compromise and botnets.”\nKey Vulnerabilities Under Active Attack\nQualys highlighted several vulnerabilities currently being exploited in the wild:\n-\nCVE-2022-47945: An RCE flaw in ThinkPHP due to improper input sanitization\n-\nCVE-2021-3129: A Laravel Ignition debugging route left active in production\n-\nCVE-2017-9841: A long-standing PHPUnit flaw exposing the eval-stdin.php script\nAttackers also exploit insecure configurations, such as active debugging tools like XDebug or improperly stored secrets.\nQualys researchers noted frequent attempts to retrieve sensitive Amazon Web Services (AWS) credential files from exposed Linux servers.\nIoT and Cloud Systems Remain Exposed\nIoT devices remain a persistent weak link, particularly those running outdated firmware. The report cites CVE-2024-3721, a TBK DVR command injection flaw exploited by Mirai-like botnets and similar attacks targeting MVPower DVRs with built-in backdoors.\n“While botnets have previously been associated with large-scale DDoS attacks and occasional crypto-mining scams, in the age of identity security threats, we see them taking on a new role in the threat ecosystem,” Maude said.\nHe explained that access to vast networks of compromised routers allows attackers to perform large-scale credential stuffing and password spraying campaigns.\nCloud-native environments are also at risk, with CVE-2022-22947 in Spring Cloud Gateway allowing unauthenticated code execution.\n“Security teams once had positive control of the data centers where production data and systems lived,” said Trey Ford, chief strategy and trust officer at Bugcrowd.\n“In the age of modern cloud-native and infrastructure as code, developers have the ability to both light up and connect services and infrastructure faster than security teams can identify it.”\nFord emphasized that “staying current with your attack surface is a critical path capability,” adding, “if you can’t see it, can’t identify changes, how can you defend it?”\nBuilding Resilience Against Exploitation\nScott Schneider, partner GTM at iCOUNTER, noted that “risk-based vulnerability management (RBVM) is an effective method to tackle an ever-growing list of vulnerabilities.”\nBy evaluating asset criticality, threat likelihood and exposure, organizations can “focus their remediation efforts on the vulnerabilities that present the most immediate and serious risks,” he explained.\nTo reduce exposure, Qualys also recommended:\n-\nTimely patching of software and frameworks\n-\nDisabling development and debugging tools in production\n-\nUsing managed stores for secrets rather than plaintext files\n-\nRestricting network access to essential IPs only\n-\nMonitoring cloud access logs for credential misuse\nQualys concluded that attackers no longer need advanced skills to launch impactful attacks.\n“With widely available exploit kits and scanning tools, even entry-level actors can cause significant damage,” the researchers said.\nThe company urged organizations to adopt continuous visibility and automated remediation to defend PHP servers, IoT devices and cloud systems from ongoing exploitation.",
