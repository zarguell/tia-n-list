    "raw": "An ex-L3 Harris executive pleaded guilty to two counts of theft of trade secrets Wednesday, admitting to selling eight zero-day exploits to a Russian broker in exchange for millions of dollars.&nbsp; Peter Williams, 39, pleaded guilty in the District Court of the District of Columbia to two counts of theft of trade secrets. Court records show that over three years, Williams exploited his access at Trenchant, a subsidiary of L3 Harris, to steal at least eight exploits. The software materials, officials said, were designed for exclusive use by the U.S. government and trusted allies. Authorities said Williams sold the stolen cyber-exploit components to a Russian entity advertising itself as a reseller of hacking tools. The broker, according to statements in court, caters to multiple clients including the Russian government. According to information revealed during the plea hearing, Williams, who also formerly served as a member of the Australian Signals Directorate, entered into several contracts with the Russian broker, exchanging the trade secrets for millions of dollars in cryptocurrency. Officials said he subsequently used the proceeds to purchase luxury items. The transactions, which took place from 2022 up until this year, were allegedly facilitated using encrypted communications channels. While the government only referred to the broker as “Company 3,” details read in court pointed to the broker as Operation Zero, which categorizes itself on its website as the “only official Russian zero-day purchase platform.” During the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tejpal Chawla read a social media post tied to Company 3, advertising millions for exploits tied to iOS and Android, further stating that “As always, the end user is a non-NATO country.” That language points to a post on X made in 2023 by Operation Zero.&nbsp; A screenshot of a tweet where Operation Zero is looking for mobile exploits. The U.S. government says Peter Williams sold exploits to Operation Zero. The charges carry a statutory maximum of 10 years in prison for each count and a fine that could reach $250,000 or twice the loss or unlawful gain involved. However, according to the federal sentencing guidelines covered during the hearing, Williams’ sentencing should fall between 87 months (seven years, three months) and 108 months (nine years). Judge Loren AliKhan will determine the final sentence.&nbsp; The Justice Department has estimated that the theft caused $35 million in losses to the defense contractor. Prosecutors said the illicit transfer of such advanced cyber capabilities to foreign actors likely afforded adversaries sophisticated tools potentially used against “numerous unsuspecting victims.” Williams also faces fines of up to $300,000, and pay restitution of $1.3 million. L3Harris declined comment through a spokesperson.&nbsp; “Williams betrayed the United States and his employer by first stealing and then selling intelligence-related software to a foreign broker that touted its ties to Russia,” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg said in a statement. Eisenberg emphasized the “deliberate and deceitful” nature of the conduct. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro described international cyber brokers as “the next wave of international arms dealers,” referencing their role in facilitating the transfer of offensive technical means. She said prosecutions of insiders and brokers remain a priority for national security investigators. Williams was placed on home confinement until his sentencing, which will be held in January.&nbsp; The post Ex-L3Harris exec pleads guilty to selling zero-day exploits to Russian broker appeared first on CyberScoop.",
