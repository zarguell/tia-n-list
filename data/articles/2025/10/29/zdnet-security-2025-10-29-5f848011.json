Not only did they reduce my day to day stress levels when I misplace my keys or wallet, but they're a great tool for helping you keep and eye on -- and even find -- things when traveling. But, as I've said many times before, AirTags aren't really designed to be discrete. In fact, they're designed to stand out to prevent them being used for stalking.\nBut there are times when discretion is a good thing. For example, if I'm using AirTags to track my luggage or backpack or expensive Gore Tex jacket, I don't want it to be easy to find and remove. Elevation Lab has the answer with its new TagVault Fabric Extreme fabric mounts.\nAlso: Can you make an AirTag last 10 years? It took me a seconds to do it\nI'm a big fan of Elevation Lab gear. They make the adapter that uses AA batteries to power an AirTag for a decade, along with a variety of things to make attaching AirTags to other things easier. And the TagVault Fabric Extreme is as good as everything else the company makes.\nThe idea is simple -- it's a little capsule attached to a piece of adhesive fabric -- but it's incredibly effective. You unscrew the capsule (like you would a big contact lens case), pop in the AirTag, screw the capsule back together, then decide where you want to attach the TagVault.\nWhen you've figured that out, peel the backing off the adhesive and attach it. This is a one way trip, so if you want a tidy, crease-free finish, be a bit more careful that I was when attaching it to the item in question!\nAfter that, you're done! According to the instructions, the adhesive takes 24 hours to achieve full stickability, but I'm here to tell you that it sticks well immediately.\nAlso: I never travel without this AirTag accessory - and it's saved me hundreds of dollars\nI've spent a lot of time coming up with ways to conceal AirTags in my stuff, going as far as to custom 3D print attachments for my Peli Air cases. But this is a far more convenient way, and it's a lot easier for when it comes time to replace the battery in the AirTag because I don't have to dig the tag out of some crevice.\nI've got these attached to a variety of things, from backpacks and suitcases to my expensive Gore Tex jacket (I usually stick them to the inside of a pocket or hear the bottom of the jacket at the back). They're tough tags that aren't bothered by things bashing into them, and the adhesive is super strong and good for a variety of surfaces, such as nylon, polyester, vinyl, rubberized fabrics, and Gore-Tex (they are not recommended for leather, fibrous fabric, or anything stretchy, or anything that has to go through the washing machine).\nAnd the adhesive doesn't seem to be bothered by rain or moisture in the least.\nI'm in the final stages of planning a long distance hike in Spain later this year, and you can be sure that these are being used on all my valuables\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe Elevation Lab TagVault Fabric Extreme tags come in singles, 2-pack, and 4-pack priced at $14.99, $24.99, and $39.99, respectively. They're a great, low-cost insurance policy against loosing of your valuables, and a great way to make use of AirTags.",
