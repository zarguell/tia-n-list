I found killer deals on laptops from the big brands: Apple, Microsoft, Dell, and more across all of the major retailers that are live right now.\nAlso: The best laptops we've tested this year\nWe've applied our rigorous testing methodology on dozens of laptops this year, evaluating performance relative to price, hardware like RAM, storage, and battery life, as well as how they handle everyday use. With that in mind, we only recommend laptops we've tested or are familiar with.\nHere are the best laptop deals we've found ahead of Black Friday.\nBest early Black Friday laptop deals\n- Current price: $999\n- Original price: $1,199\nThe MacBook Air M4 was released earlier in 2025, so it's still the latest MacBook Air on the market you can get. It comes with more base memory than previous versions (16GB of unified RAM) with a gorgeous Liquid retina display that supports up to two additional monitors. This model comes with 512GB SSD storage, but you can also find one with 256GB for just $799.\n- Current price: $139\n- Regular price: $219\nLooking for a well-priced Chromebook for handling the basics? The CX15 is one of the best options out there. We went hands-on with this Chromebook earlier this year and praised its durability, full-sized keyboard, and nice trackpad. Walmart has it on sale right now for $139, a price you can't argue with.\n- Current price: $1,549\n- Regular price: $1,949\nIf you prioritize a laptop with a gorgeous display, the Yoga Pro 9i has one of the best around. It comes with a 16-inch OLED by default, but pairing the tandem OLED with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 GPU results in a brilliant image. In that vein, it approaches gaming, productivity, and creative work equally well, with extensive connectivity and 32GB of RAM.\nReview: Upgrading to a Windows 11 laptop? This Lenovo with a tandem OLED display I tested is a win\n- Current price: $1,549\n- Regular price: $1,799\nThe 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip is down to a very competitive price at B&H right now. With 24GB of unified RAM and a gorgeous 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, the MacBook Pro M4 is fast, reliable, and a joy to use for work or everyday use. The 12MP Center Stage camera makes for an especially good videoconferencing experience, something we called out in our review earlier this year.\n- Current price: $1,249\n- Regular price: $1,549\nWe praised the Dell 14 Premium for its sleek design (reminiscent of the iconic XPS) with its edge-to-edge OLED display and invisible trackpad, but it has the hardware to back up the bold design. You've got an Intel Core Ultra 7 255H processor, up to 32GB of LPDDR5X, 8400MT/s dual-channel RAM, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU.\n- Current price:\n- Regular price:\nThe IdeaPad Slim 5i is Lenovo's budget-friendly line of jack-of-all-trades laptops, geared for all-around usability with a thin and light form factor. This one still features a nice sized 16-inch display and full-sized keyboard, but keeps things affordable with an Intel Core 5 processor and 16GB of RAM; ideal for everyday tasks.\n- Lenovo ThinkPad E16: $909 (save $330 at Lenovo): This 16-inch ThinkPad from the E series features an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and full-sized keyboard with all the I/O and connectivity you'd expect from a ThinkPad.\n- HP OmniBook X Flip 2-in-1: $699 (save $350 at Best Buy): This 14-inch 2-in-1 is a thin and light all-around device that's well-equipped for a variety of use cases. The Intel Core Ultra 7 processor enables great battery life and snappy performance.\n- Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge (15-inch): $684 (save $215 at Amazon): We praised the Galaxy Book4 Edge for its brilliant display and ultrathin form factor, and at this price should be a major consideration for anyone looking to score a deal.\nLaptop deals under $500\n- Current price: $180\n- Regular price: $449\nOne of our favorite budget laptops, the Aspire Go 15, is down to just $180 at Walmart ahead of Black Friday. This 15.6-inch laptop has a hardware loadout that's ideal for everyday tasks like surfing the web, checking email, and running Microsoft 365 productivity apps like Word and Excel.\n- Current price: $349\n- Regular price: $499\nOne of our top-rated budget laptops, the Vivobook 15 has an Intel Core 5 CPU, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for a very affordable price of $349 at Walmart for the configuration without the OLED display.\n- HP 15-inch laptop: $499 (save $400 at Amazon): This 15.6-inch laptop has a full keyboard, 32GB of RAM and a full 1TB SSD for nearly half off.\n- Acer Aspire Premium 3: $312: (save $49 at Amazon): This 15-inch from Acer's budget lineup has an AMD Ryzen 3 CPU and modest hardware loadout that's ideal for everyday tasks like surfing the web, YouTube, and catching up on emails.\n- Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook: $329 (save $870 at Amazon): This thin and lightweight Chromebook features 4GB of RAM and a super-efficient MediaTek Kompanio processor for all-day battery life.\nGaming laptop deals\n- Current price: $629\n- Regular price: $899\nLooking for a gaming laptop that won't break the bank? Acer's Nitro lineup is well-known in the gamer community for making solid, no-frills gaming laptops that strip the fancy bells and whistles for machines that just work. The Nitro V 16 AI features an AMD Ryzen 5 240 processor, Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 GPU, and 8GB of RAM to keep things affordable. This laptop isn't at the cutting edge of gaming performance, but it'll run most games with respectable performance.\n- Current price: $599\n- Regular price: $1,049\nHP's 15-inch Victus has a minimalist design with a thin and light form factor and mid-range hardware geared toward gaming performance. However, the full-sized keyboard and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU enables creative workflows as well, especially with the 144Hz refresh rate.\n- Current price: $1,199\n- Regular price: $1,699\nIntel Core Ultra 7 CPU, Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 graphics card, and 32GB of RAM, but it's also versatile enough to take on other roles. This is a laptop you could easily take to the office or use as a video editing workstation, as the 15.1-inch OLED display is the cherry on top.\nFAQs\nWhen is Black Friday?\nBlack Friday is Friday, Nov. 28, the day after Thanksgiving. While it's typically associated with general retail sales, we're seeing a lot more online deals, as well. Cyber Monday, the traditional online shopping sale day, is Monday, Dec. 1. Both of these days will have some great deals, and there will be some overlap.\nAre laptops really cheaper during Black Friday?\nAbsolutely. Both Black Friday and Cyber Monday see price drops that are often better than regular sales. Online retailers feel the pressure to deliver significant deals during the holiday, and consumers expect to find exclusive deals that are better than regular sales.\nHow did we choose these early Black Friday deals?\nZDNET focuses on products we've either covered personally or can vouch for through personal use. We've tested and reviewed almost all of the products on this list, linking to our reviews wherever possible to help provide context around each individual product.\nOur experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.",
