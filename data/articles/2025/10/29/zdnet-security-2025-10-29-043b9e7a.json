This year, it falls on Friday, Nov. 28. However, you can expect deals the week leading up to the day, as well as all weekend long.\nAre deals really better on Black Friday?\nFor some big-name brands, Black Friday is the only time specific devices go on sale all year. It's also the time of year that you'll see the biggest discounts on bigger devices, such as phones, laptops, TVs, tablets, etc. So yes, it's definitely a better time to snag a deal than other sales events.\nHow did we choose these Black Friday deals?\nZDNET only writes about deals we want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.\nWe also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.",
