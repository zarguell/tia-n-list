    "full": "Microsoft is suffering an ongoing DNS outage affecting customers worldwide, preventing them from logging into company networks and accessing Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 services.\nAccording to reports on DownDetector and social networks, this incident began impacting Microsoft's services almost 1 hour ago and is currently causing server and website connection issues for tens of thousands of users.\nSome of those affected are having issues accessing the Intune and Azure portals, as well as the Exchange admin center, while others report that Microsoft's Azure Front Door Content Delivery Network (CDN) service is also down.\nCustomers affected by this ongoing outage, including healthcare organizations, are also reporting authentication issues that are preventing employees from logging into their company networks and online business platforms.\nThe incident's impact is widespread, affecting Microsoft customers worldwide, including the Dutch railway system, which is reportedly experiencing issues with its online travel planning platforms and ticket machines.\n\"Weâ€™re aware that the Provider Portal login is currently unavailable due to a Microsoft outage affecting authentication services,\" one affected customer says. \"Our team is actively working to restore anything impacted and monitoring progress closely as Microsoft Azure systems recover.\"\nAt the moment, Microsoft is blaming these ongoing service access problems on a DNS issue, and added that impacted customers may experience intermittent request failures or latency while trying to access some Microsoft services.\n\"Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing DNS issues resulting in availability degradation of some services. Customers may experience issues accessing the Azure Portal. We have taken action that is expected to address the portal access issues here shortly,\" Microsoft said on the Azure status page.\n\"Users may be unable to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and see delays when accessing other Microsoft 365 services. Additionally, admins are reporting issues when attempting to access some Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Intune functions. Users are also seeing issues with add-ins and network connectivity in Outlook,\" it added in a separate service alert (MO1181369) on the Microsoft 365 admin portal.\nMicrosoft is now reviewing all reports of issues affecting Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 services, including those related to problems accessing the Microsoft 365 admin center and other services.\n\"We're reviewing corresponding service telemetry to isolate the cause of the issue and determine our next troubleshooting steps,\" Microsoft said.\nThis follows a massive AWS (Amazon Web Services) outage last week that brought down millions of online services and websites due to a major DNS failure.\nUpdate October 29, 12:59 EDT: Microsoft confirmed that its Azure Front Door CDN service and the Azure Portal are down and advised customers to use programmatic methods (PowerShell, CLI, etc.) to access resources if they are unable to access the portal directly.\n\"We are actively assessing failover options of internal services from our AFD infrastructure. Our investigation into the contributing factors and additional recovery workstreams continues,\" it said in an Azure status update.\nAccording to a separate Microsoft 365 admin center update, the company is also rerouting affected traffic to alternate healthy infrastructure as a short-term solution while investigating the source of the issue.\nUpdate October 29, 13:06 EDT: Microsoft has revised the Azure status incident report to blame an Azure Front Door configuration change for the outage.\n\"Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing Azure Front Door issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services. We suspect that an inadvertent configuration change as the trigger event for this issue,\" it said.\n\"We are taking two concurrent actions where we are blocking all changes to the AFD services and at the same time rolling back to our last known good state.\"\nPicus Blue Report 2025 is Here: 2X increase in password cracking\n46% of environments had passwords cracked, nearly doubling from 25% last year.\nGet the Picus Blue Report 2025 now for a comprehensive look at more findings on prevention, detection, and data exfiltration trends.",
