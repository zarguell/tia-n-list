    "full": "Microsoft is suffering an ongoing DNS outage affecting customers worldwide, preventing them from logging into company networks and accessing Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 services.\nAccording to reports on DownDetector and social networks, this incident began impacting Microsoft's services almost 1 hour ago and is currently causing server and website connection issues for tens of thousands of users.\nSome of those affected are having issues accessing the Intune and Azure portals, as well as the Exchange admin center, while others report that Microsoft's Azure Front Door Content Delivery Network (CDN) service is also down.\nCustomers affected by this ongoing outage, including healthcare organizations, are also reporting authentication issues that are preventing employees from logging into their company networks and online business platforms.\nThe incident's impact is widespread, affecting Microsoft customers worldwide, including the Dutch railway system, which is reportedly experiencing issues with its online travel planning platforms and ticket machines.\n\"Weâ€™re aware that the Provider Portal login is currently unavailable due to a Microsoft outage affecting authentication services,\" one affected customer says. \"Our team is actively working to restore anything impacted and monitoring progress closely as Microsoft Azure systems recover.\"\nAt the moment, Microsoft is blaming these ongoing service access problems on a DNS issue, and added that impacted customers may experience intermittent request failures or latency while trying to access some Microsoft services.\n\"Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing DNS issues resulting in availability degradation of some services. Customers may experience issues accessing the Azure Portal. We have taken action that is expected to address the portal access issues here shortly,\" Microsoft said on the Azure status page.\n\"Users may be unable to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and see delays when accessing other Microsoft 365 services. Additionally, admins are reporting issues when attempting to access some Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Intune functions. Users are also seeing issues with add-ins and network connectivity in Outlook,\" it added in a separate service alert (MO1181369) on the Microsoft 365 admin portal.\nMicrosoft directed users to find more information about this outage on the status.cloud.microsoft page; however, like many of the company's online platforms and services, this page is also down.\nMicrosoft is now reviewing all reports of issues affecting Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 services, including those related to problems accessing the Microsoft 365 admin center and other services.\n\"We're reviewing corresponding service telemetry to isolate the cause of the issue and determine our next troubleshooting steps,\" Microsoft said.\nThis follows a massive AWS (Amazon Web Services) outage last week that brought down millions of online services and websites due to a major DNS failure.\nUpdate October 29, 12:59 EDT: Microsoft confirmed that its Azure Front Door CDN service and the Azure Portal are down and advised customers to use programmatic methods (PowerShell, CLI, etc.) to access resources if they are unable to access the portal directly.\n\"We are actively assessing failover options of internal services from our AFD infrastructure. Our investigation into the contributing factors and additional recovery workstreams continues,\" it said in an Azure status update.\nAccording to a separate Microsoft 365 admin center update, the company is also rerouting affected traffic to alternate healthy infrastructure as a short-term solution while investigating the source of the issue.\nUpdate October 29, 13:06 EDT: Microsoft has revised the Azure status incident report to blame an Azure Front Door configuration change for the outage.\n\"Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing Azure Front Door issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services. We suspect that an inadvertent configuration change as the trigger event for this issue,\" it said.\n\"We are taking two concurrent actions where we are blocking all changes to the AFD services and at the same time rolling back to our last known good state.\"\nUpdate October 29, 15:30 EDT: Microsoft says it expects full recovery within the next 4 hours. Until then, it advised customers to implement failover strategies using Azure Traffic Manager to redirect traffic from Azure Front Door to their origin servers by following the guidance available HERE.\n\"This means we expect recovery to happen by 23:20 UTC on 29 October 2025. We will provide another update on our progress within two hours, or sooner if warranted,\" Microsoft stated.\nUpdate October 30, 06:49 EDT: Microsoft says the Azure configuration change that caused the outage has been reverted, and the outage has been mitigated.\n\"After extended monitoring, we confirmed that impact stemming from the Azure configuration change has been resolved,\" it said.\nIn a separate Microsoft 365 admin center update, Redmond said the incident impacted the following services and triggered various problems, including:\n- Access to some Microsoft Entra, Microsoft Power Apps, Microsoft Intune, and Microsoft Defender functions.\n- Microsoft Purview Information Protection (MIP), Data Lifecycle Management (DLM), eDiscovery, Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management (IRM), Communications Compliance, Data Governance, and other related Microsoft Purview features.\n- Access to the Exchange admin center (EAC), security.microsoft.com, learn.microsoft.com, and other portals accessed through microsoft.com.\n- Issues with add-ins and network connectivity in Outlook.\n- Degraded functionality to some workflows within Microsoft Teams, including impact to location data in support of emergency calls. Users may also see transcription failures and issues leveraging Copilot within meetings.\n- High latency, timeouts, errors, or inaccessibility of Microsoft Copilot Dashboards, Copilot Analytics Power BI reports, and advanced reporting capabilities.\n- Intermittent connectivity and device discovery issues for Windows 365 Cloud PC users, and issues for admins performing device actions and provisioning new Cloud PCs.\nPicus Blue Report 2025 is Here: 2X increase in password cracking\n46% of environments had passwords cracked, nearly doubling from 25% last year.\nGet the Picus Blue Report 2025 now for a comprehensive look at more findings on prevention, detection, and data exfiltration trends.",
