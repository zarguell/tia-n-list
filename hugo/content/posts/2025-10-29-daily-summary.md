## Zero‚ÄëDay Vulnerabilities & Exploits

‚ö° **DELMIA Factory Software** ‚Äì Two actively exploited CVEs (CVE‚Äë2025‚Äë24893, CVE‚Äë2025‚Äë6204, CVE‚Äë2025‚Äë6205) are currently being leveraged by threat actors to compromise industrial control environments.  
- The CVE‚Äë2025‚Äë24893 vulnerability was reported in a recent XWiki incident where a malicious miner used the flaw to gain persistence on web servers.  
- CVE‚Äë2025‚Äë6204/6205 affect Dassault applications; the exploit chain involves remote code execution via malformed XML payloads.  

**Actionable steps**  
- **Patch immediately**: Deploy the latest vendor patches for DELMIA, XWiki, and Dassault products.  
- **Validate**: Run CVE‚Äëcheck scanners to confirm remediation.  
- **Monitor**: Watch for unusual outbound traffic from affected IPs, especially to known malicious domains.

## Malware & Threat Actors

### PhantomRaven npm Campaign  
- A new wave of npm packages has been injected with credential‚Äëstealing payloads.  
- Attackers are flooding the registry with ‚Äúbenign‚Äù modules that secretly exfiltrate API keys and user credentials.

### Npm Malware ‚Äì Invisible Dependencies  
- Malicious code is hidden within dependencies that are not listed in `package.json`, making detection difficult for static analysis tools.  

### Qilin Ransomware  
- **File indicator**: `eskle.sys`  
- Qilin leverages Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run Linux‚Äëbased encryptors on Windows hosts, bypassing traditional antivirus heuristics.

**Actionable steps**  
- **Audit npm packages**: Verify the integrity of all dependencies; use lockfile checksums and publisher validation.  
- **Block unknown source URLs**: Configure npm to allow only trusted registries.  
- **Enable WSL monitoring**: Look for `eskle.sys` in system directories and block its execution.  
- **Update endpoint protection**: Ensure AV signatures are current and enable WSL filesystem scanning.

## Security Breaches & Incidents

| Incident | Impact | Immediate Action |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| **Dentsu ‚Äì Merkle Data Breach** | Sensitive customer data exfiltrated from the Merkle subsidiary. | Notify affected parties, conduct forensic analysis, and strengthen access controls. |
| **DDR5 Memory Attack** | Attackers target DDR5 memory to steal keys from Intel and AMD TEEs. | Verify firmware updates for memory modules; monitor for unauthorized key extraction attempts. |
| **F5 Nation‚ÄëState Attack** | Prolonged attack reported; vendor claims limited impact. | Review F5 logs for anomalous traffic; verify that the latest security patches are applied. |
| **PHP & IoT Devices** | Growing cyber‚Äëattack risks involving CVE‚Äë2017‚Äë9841, CVE‚Äë2021‚Äë3129, CVE‚Äë2022‚Äë47945. | Patch PHP installations, harden IoT device firmware, and isolate vulnerable devices. |
| **PhantomRaven npm Package Flood** | Credential‚Äëstealing packages infiltrated npm registry. | Same as above in Malware section. |

## Vendor & Platform Updates

### Microsoft  
- **Windows Update Fix**: 0x800F081F error resolved, restoring normal update functionality.  
- **Windows‚ÄØ11 KB5067036**: Adds Administrator Protection feature ‚Äì improves privilege escalation prevention.  
- **Media Creation Tool**: Broken on some Windows PCs ‚Äì issue fixed; users should re‚Äëinstall the tool.  

**Actionable steps**  
- **Apply latest Windows updates**: Ensure KB5067036

## üé≠ Intelligence Perspective

While analyzing serious threats, remember to maintain perspective:

_What do you get when you cross a bee and a sheep? A bah-humbug._

A balanced mindset leads to better decision-making.
