## 🔴 Critical Threats

**Ransomware gangs adopt Shanya EXE packer to bypass EDR solutions**
Multiple ransomware groups including Medusa, Qilin, Crytox, and Akira are increasingly using "Shanya," a packer-as-a-service platform that helps hide EDR-killing payloads from security tools. The packer inserts malicious code into legitimate-looking Windows DLL files and keeps execution entirely in memory, making detection extremely difficult. Shanya also includes anti-analysis techniques that crash when run under debuggers. The service has grown significantly since late 2024, with activity detected in Tunisia, UAE, Costa Rica, Nigeria, and Pakistan. So what? This represents a new commercialization of advanced evasion techniques that lowers the technical barrier for ransomware operators to disable endpoint security. Security teams should monitor for unusual DLL loading patterns and implement memory-based detection capabilities.

**Malicious VSCode extensions drop infostealers through Microsoft's registry**
Two malicious extensions, "Bitcoin Black" and "Codo AI," have been discovered in Microsoft's Visual Studio Code Marketplace, delivering information-stealing malware that can take screenshots, steal credentials, crypto wallets, and hijack browser sessions. Published under the developer name 'BigBlack,' the extensions use PowerShell or batch scripts to download malicious DLL files, then employ DLL hijacking to deploy infostealers under the name runtime.exe. The malware creates an "Evelyn" directory in %APPDATA%\Local\ to store stolen data, including WiFi credentials, system information, and screenshots. So what? This represents a supply chain attack on a trusted developer platform that bypasses traditional security controls. Development teams should implement strict extension approval processes and monitor for suspicious PowerShell activity.

**GrayBravo's CastleLoader MaaS ecosystem expands with four distinct activity clusters**
Insikt Group has identified four separate activity clusters leveraging GrayBravo's CastleLoader malware, each with unique TTPs and victim profiles, confirming the threat actor operates a malware-as-a-service model. Cluster TAG-160 specifically targets the logistics sector through phishing and ClickFix techniques, while TAG-161 impersonates Booking.com. The group has developed multiple malware families including CastleLoader, CastleBot, and CastleRAT, with infrastructure showing deliberate redundancy through overlapping C2 servers and shared RC4 encryption keys. So what? This demonstrates how sophisticated malware operations are increasingly franchising their capabilities, making attribution more difficult while expanding their reach across sectors. Security teams should implement the provided YARA, Snort, and Sigma rules to detect these specific malware families.

**UK cyber agency warns LLMs will always be vulnerable to prompt injection**
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre issued a technical assessment stating that prompt injection is an inherent architectural flaw in large language models that may never be fully mitigated. Unlike SQL injection which has established prevention methods, LLMs fundamentally cannot distinguish between trusted instructions and untrusted data, making them susceptible to manipulation through hidden prompts. The warning highlights that even enterprise AI implementations remain vulnerable to attacks that could exfiltrate sensitive data or manipulate model behavior. So what? As organizations increasingly implement AI tools, this architectural limitation represents a fundamental security challenge that cannot be solved through traditional patching. Security teams must implement compensating controls like strict output validation, user confirmation requirements, and monitoring for anomalous AI behavior.
