## 🔴 Critical Threats & Active Exploitation

**[NEW] APT28 exploits Microsoft Office zero-day in active espionage campaign**  
Russian state actors are exploiting CVE-2026-21509, a critical Microsoft Office vulnerability, in attacks targeting Ukraine, Slovakia, Romania, and other European countries. The campaign dubbed "Operation Neusploit" uses weaponized RTF files to deliver either MiniDoor email theft malware or PixyNetLoader deploying Covenant Grunt implants via steganography hidden in PNG files. Microsoft issued an out-of-band patch on January 26, but exploitation continued through at least January 29. Attackers employ server-side checks to only deliver malicious payloads to targeted regions with correct User-Agent headers, using Filen API for command-and-control communications [[Zscaler ThreatLabz](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/apt28-leverages-cve-2026-21509-operation-neusploit)]; [CERT-UA](http://cert.gov.ua/article/6287250)]; [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-hackers-exploit-recently-patched-microsoft-office-bug-in-attacks/)].

**[UPDATE] Notepad++ supply chain attack reveals sophisticated multi-month operation**  
Lotus Blossom (China-nexus APT) compromised Notepad++ update infrastructure for six months, deploying multiple attack chains and the previously undocumented Chrysalis backdoor. Researchers identified three distinct infection chains from July-October 2025, each rotating infrastructure and payloads, including Cobalt Strike beacons and custom backdoors using encryption mimicking Deepseek API traffic. The campaign targeted government organizations in the Philippines, financial entities in El Salvador, and IT providers in Vietnam, with malware deployed via malicious update.exe files from compromised update servers [[Kaspersky Securelist](https://securelist.com/notepad-supply-chain-attack/118708/)]; [CyberPress](https://cyberpress.org/notepad-supply-chain-hack-exposed/)]; [CyberScoop](https://www.cyberscoop.com/china-espionage-group-lotus-blossom-attacks-notepad/)].

**[NEW] Sandworm deploys DynoWiper against Polish energy company**  
Russia-linked Sandworm targeted a Polish energy firm with new wiper malware in late December 2025, marking an expansion beyond their traditional Ukrainian focus. DynoWiper overwrites files with random buffers, deletes directory contents, and forces system reboots in three phases - behavior similar to the earlier ZOV wiper but with enhanced evasion techniques. Attackers gained domain admin access via Active Directory, deployed PowerShell scripts through Group Policy, and used Rubeus for Kerberos attacks plus rsocx SOCKS5 proxy for lateral movement. ESET blocked the attack, limiting damage to the energy sector target [[ESET WeLiveSecurity](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/dynowiper-update-technical-analysis-attribution/)]; [CyberPress](https://cyberpress.org/dynowiper-hits-energy-firms/)].

## 🎯 Threat Actor Activity & Campaigns

**[NEW] GhostChat spyware targets Pakistani users with romance deception**  
A sophisticated Android spyware campaign dubbed GhostChat (Android/Spy.GhostChat.A) is targeting Pakistani users through a fake dating app that demands hardcoded "unlock passcodes" for access. The malware steals contacts, files, and real-time data including new photos and documents, uploading everything to a C&C server. ESET linked GhostChat to a broader campaign also using GhostPairing to hijack WhatsApp accounts via QR code scans impersonating Pakistan's Ministry of Defence. The app is distributed outside official stores, relying on social engineering tactics and hardcoded credentials to appear legitimate [[ESET Research](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/love-actually-fake-dating-app-used-lure-targeted-spyware-campaign-pakistan/)]; [CyberPress](https://cyberpress.org/ghostchat-app-locks-devices/)].

**[NEW] Anatsa banking trojan spreads via Google Play with 50K+ downloads**  
The notorious Anatsa banking trojan was distributed through "StellarGrid," a malicious document reader app on Google Play that accumulated over 50,000 downloads. The app functions as a dropper, fetching Anatsa from external servers after installation to overlay fake login screens on banking apps and steal credentials. Anatsa has historically targeted over 100 banks across Europe and the US, employing automated transfer service attacks to move money directly from compromised accounts. The malicious app remains available for download, requiring immediate uninstallation [[ThreatLabz](https://x.com/Threatlabz/status/2018366059452199168)]; [CyberPress](https://cyberpress.org/anatsa-trojan-hits-google/)].
