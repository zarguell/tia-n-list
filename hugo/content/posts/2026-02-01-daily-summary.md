## 🔴 Critical Threats & Active Exploitation

**[NEW] 0apt ransomware campaign escalates with multi-sector attacks**  
The 0apt ransomware group has conducted at least five major attacks in 72 hours across critical infrastructure, logistics, and technology sectors, exfiltrating over 450GB from Apex Logistics alone. The campaign leverages stolen credentials and initial access brokers, with attacks targeting driver licenses, truck routes, and cargo contents at Meridian Logistics [[DeXpose](https://www.dexpose.io/0apt-strikes-meridian-logistics-in-targeted-ransomware-attack/)], and SCADA logs and customer billing data at UK energy provider Solstice Energy Grid [[DeXpose](https://www.dexpose.io/0apt-ransomware-attack-on-solstice-energy-grid/)]. The group's expansion into Eastern Europe includes NeoTech Solutions in Serbia, where source code and API keys were compromised [[DeXpose](https://www.dexpose.io/0apt-ransomware-attack-on-neotech-solutions-in-serbia/)]. All affected organizations should immediately rotate credentials and check for signs of lateral movement.

**[NEW] Cloud storage phishing campaign floods inboxes with fake renewals**  
A large-scale phishing campaign is bombarding users with fake cloud storage renewal notices, using urgency tactics to trick victims into clicking malicious links that redirect to affiliate marketing pages for VPN services and security software. The emails claim payment failures and imminent data loss, with personalized subject lines including "[name], Your Cloud Account has been locked" and "Immediate Action Required. Payment Declined" [[BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cloud-storage-payment-scam-floods-inboxes-with-fake-renewals/)]. Attackers leverage Google Cloud Storage URLs to host redirectors that ultimately collect payment information for unrelated products. Users should verify cloud storage status directly through official apps rather than email links.

**[NEW] eScan antivirus compromised in supply chain attack**  
SecurityWeek reports that eScan Antivirus delivered malware to customers through a supply chain attack, though technical details remain limited [[SecurityWeek](https://www.securityweek.com/escan-antivirus-delivers-malware-in-supply-chain-attack/)]. This incident demonstrates the continued targeting of security vendors as distribution vectors for malicious code. Organizations using eScan should immediately scan their environments with alternative security tools and review telemetry for suspicious activities originating from eScan processes.

**[NEW] Instagram private profiles leaking photos via authorization bypass**  
A security researcher discovered that certain private Instagram profiles were embedding links to private photos and captions in HTML responses to unauthenticated visitors. The vulnerability, affecting approximately 28% of tested accounts, was reportedly fixed by Meta in October 2025 but dismissed as "unreproducible" by the company [[BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researcher-reveals-evidence-of-private-instagram-profiles-leaking-photos/)]. The exploit required specific mobile user agents and headers, allowing unauthorized access to supposedly private content. Organizations should consider implementing additional controls for employee social media accounts containing sensitive information.

## 🎯 Threat Actor Activity & Campaigns

**[UPDATE] Mandiant releases detailed ShinyHunters SSO vishing analysis**  
Building on last week's coverage, Mandiant has provided comprehensive technical details on ShinyHunters' SSO credential theft operations. Threat actors impersonate IT support staff during vishing calls, directing targets to phishing sites that capture SSO credentials and MFA codes in real-time [[BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mandiant-details-how-shinyhunters-abuse-sso-to-steal-cloud-data/)]. Once authenticated, attackers access Okta, Microsoft Entra, or Google SSO dashboards as a springboard to compromise Salesforce, Microsoft 365, SharePoint, DocuSign, and other SaaS applications. Detection recommendations include monitoring for PowerShell User-Agent access to SharePoint/OneDrive, unexpected Google Workspace OAuth authorizations for "ToogleBox Recall," and deletion of MFA modification notifications. Mandiant has released specific detection rules for Google SecOps environments.

**[NEW] Additional ransomware operations targeting specific sectors**  
Three separate ransomware groups claimed new victims: Chaos ransomware struck Anomatic Corporation, a U.S. manufacturer of anodized aluminum and metalized packaging [[DeXpose](https://www.dexpose.io/chaos-ransomware-targets-anomatic-corporation/)], while Qilin targeted UK industrial machinery company Moontown [[DeXpose](https://www.dexpose.io/qilin-ransomware-strikes-moontown-in-the-uk/)], and Devman compromised Zallc.org, exposing PII, SSNs, and financial reports [[DeXpose](https://www.dexpose.io/devman-ransomware-attack-on-zallc-org-exposes-sensitive-data/)]. These attacks highlight ransomware groups' continued sector-focused targeting and the need for industry-specific threat intelligence sharing.

## ⚠️ Vulnerabilities & Patches

**[NEW] macOS persistence via shell environment hijacking**  
Researchers demonstrated how macOS malware can achieve persistence by modifying ~/.zshenv or ~/.zshrc files to execute malicious code each time a terminal opens. This "Living off the Land" technique avoids the "Background Items Added" notification triggered by LaunchAgents [[cocomelonc](https://cocomelonc.github.io/macos/2026/01/31/malware-mac-persistence-2.html)]. Threat actor OceanLotus has previously used this method as a failsafe persistence mechanism alongside LaunchAgents. Blue teams should monitor for unauthorized modifications to shell configuration files and implement file integrity monitoring on user home directories.

**[NEW] GitHub Actions security hardening guide released**  
SOCFortress published CIS-aligned technical guidance for securing GitHub Actions and CI/CD pipelines, highlighting critical controls including restricting actions to verified publishers, implementing minimum required permissions, disabling secrets for fork-based PRs, and isolating self-hosted runners [[SOCFortress](https://socfortress.medium.com/secure-use-of-github-cis-aligned-technical-guide-part-iv-8e28a1f1ba1e)]. The guidance addresses the high-risk attack surface presented by compromised workflows that can lead to cloud credential theft, infrastructure takeover, and supply-chain compromise. Organizations should immediately review their GitHub Actions configurations against these CIS benchmarks.
