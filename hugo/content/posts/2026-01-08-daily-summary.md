## 🔴 Critical Threats & Active Exploitation

**[NEW] CISA warns of active exploitation of 17-year-old Microsoft PowerPoint vulnerability**  
Attackers are actively exploiting CVE-2009-0556, a critical code injection vulnerability in Microsoft PowerPoint that enables arbitrary code execution through specially crafted presentations [[CyberPress](https://cyberpress.org/powerpoint-code-injection-flaw/)]. The vulnerability, which Microsoft patched in 2009, allows attackers to compromise systems by abusing how PowerPoint processes internal file structures. CISA has added this to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog and mandated federal agencies to patch by January 28, 2026. Any organization running unpatched Office installations faces immediate risk of malware deployment and lateral movement through this vector [[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)].

**[NEW] Hackers actively exploit VMware ESXi with zero-day MAESTRO toolkit**  
A sophisticated attack campaign is targeting VMware ESXi instances using a zero-day exploit toolkit called MAESTRO, which chains three previously unknown vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-22226, CVE-2025-22224, CVE-2025-22225) to achieve virtual machine escape [[Huntress](https://www.huntress.com/blog/esxi-vm-escape-exploit)] [[GBHackers](https://gbhackers.com/cybercriminals-exploit-vmware-esxi-vulnerabilities/)]. Attackers gain initial access through compromised VPN appliances, then deploy the toolkit to break out of guest environments and gain host system control. The backdoor hijacks ESXi's inetd service using VSOCK for covert guest-to-host communication, rendering it invisible to standard network monitoring. VMware ESXi versions from 5.1 through 8.0 without patches are vulnerable, requiring immediate emergency patching of hypervisor infrastructure.

**[NEW] Max severity Ni8mare flaw allows hijacking of n8n automation servers**  
A critical vulnerability dubbed "Ni8mare" (CVE-2026-21858) enables unauthenticated remote code execution against n8n workflow automation platforms affecting approximately 100,000 servers globally [[CyberScoop](https://cyberscoop.com/n8n-critical-vulnerability-massive-risk/)] [[BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/max-severity-ni8mare-flaw-lets-hackers-hijack-n8n-servers/)]. The flaw stems from content-type confusion in webhook parsing, allowing attackers to bypass file upload restrictions and read arbitrary files.
