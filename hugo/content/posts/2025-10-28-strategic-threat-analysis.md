## ⚡ New Malware‑as‑a‑Service: Atroposia

- **Emergence of Atroposia** – The Bleeping Computer report identifies Atroposia as a *new* malware‑as‑a‑service (MaaS) platform.  
- **Built‑in Local Vulnerability Scanner** – Atroposia bundles a local scanner that can discover and exploit host‑side weaknesses on compromised systems, enabling operators to pivot rapidly.  
- **Implication for defenders** – Any detected Atroposia activity should trigger a full host‑based audit and immediate scanning for known vulnerability signatures.  
- **Recommendation** – Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) agents that can flag suspicious script execution and scanner binaries.
