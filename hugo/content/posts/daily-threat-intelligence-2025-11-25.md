# Daily Threat Intelligence Digest - November 25, 2025

Good morning,

Welcome to your daily threat intelligence digest for November 25, 2025. Today's landscape presents a mix of critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention, significant operational disruptions from software bugs, and ongoing risks stemming from supply chain compromises. We also observe innovative strategies being deployed to bolster cyber capabilities on a national level, highlighting the dynamic nature of the digital domain.

At the forefront of today's concerns is a critical vulnerability identified in **Oracle Identity Manager**, tracked as **CVE-2025-61757**. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an urgent directive for organizations to patch this flaw immediately, as it is being actively exploited in the wild. Discovered by Searchlight Cyber on November 20th and quickly added to CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, this flaw resides in the REST WebServices component of Oracle Fusion Middleware. With a severe CVSS score of 9.8, it allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems (versions 12.2.1.4.0 and 14.1.2.1.0), potentially leading to a complete takeover of Oracle Identity Manager. The ease of exploitation, requiring no prior credentials or system access, makes it a prime target for sophisticated adversaries, including ransomware operators and state-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. Organizations running Oracle Identity Governance Suite 12c are strongly advised to apply the relevant patches without delay or, failing that, to isolate affected services from public internet access.

Meanwhile, Microsoft has confirmed a significant operational challenge for users of **Windows 11 24H2**. A critical bug, present in cumulative updates released since July 2025, is causing the **File Explorer, Start Menu, and other essential system components to crash**. This issue primarily affects users logging in after applying these updates, and is particularly problematic in non-persistent operating system installations, such as virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environments where app packages reinstall with each session. The root cause is a timing issue where XAML dependency packages (specifically MicrosoftWindows.Client.CBS, Microsoft.UI.Xaml.CBS, and MicrosoftWindows.Client.Core) fail to register correctly post-update. This cascade effect prevents crucial interface components like Explorer.exe, StartMenuExperienceHost, and ShellHost.exe from initializing, leading to visible errors, missing taskbars, or silently failing systems. While not a direct security vulnerability, this bug poses a substantial operational disruption, severely impacting user productivity and system stability.

The persistent threat of **supply chain attacks** continues to manifest, as evidenced by **Iberia Airlines** notifying customers of a recent data breach. The Spanish carrier, part of the International Airlines Group (IAG), revealed that personal information was compromised via unauthorized access to one of its supplier's systems. While Iberia was quick to assure customers that no login credentials or financial details were accessed, the compromised data includes first and last names, email addresses, and loyalty card identification numbers (Iberia Club). This type of information, though not directly financial, is highly valuable to threat actors for crafting targeted phishing attacks, potentially leading to further compromise. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the expanded attack surface presented by third-party vendors and the critical need for robust supply chain security measures.

On a forward-looking note, the **UK Ministry of Defence (MoD)** has launched the world’s first military esports tournament, the **International Defence Esports Games (IDEG)**. This initiative, which gathered 40 allied nations in London, aims to enhance the cyber and digital skills of military personnel, which are deemed essential for modern warfare. The three-day competition, scheduled for October 9-11, 2026, will feature virtual events and summits covering cybersecurity, AI, and drone operations. The MoD believes that competitive gaming can play a vital role in developing battlefield skills such as multi-threat tracking, real-time tactical adjustments, and performing under pressure, citing the effective use of drone simulator games by the Ukrainian military. This innovative approach underscores a growing recognition of the interconnectedness between digital proficiencies and traditional defense capabilities.

## Key Insights

*   **Immediate Action Required for Critical Vulnerabilities:** The active exploitation of CVE-2025-61757 in Oracle Identity Manager necessitates immediate patching or isolation of affected systems to prevent unauthenticated remote code execution and potential system takeover.
*   **Operational Stability at Risk from Software Bugs:** The confirmed Windows 11 24H2 bug highlights how even non-exploitable software flaws can severely impact operational continuity and user experience, particularly in environments relying on frequent updates or non-persistent OS installations.
*   **Supply Chain Remains a Primary Vector for Data Breaches:** The Iberia Airlines incident reinforces the ongoing risk posed by compromised third-party suppliers, leading to the exposure of sensitive personal data and an increased risk of subsequent phishing attacks against affected customers.

Looking ahead, the evolving threat landscape demands continuous vigilance against actively exploited vulnerabilities, meticulous management of software updates to maintain operational stability, and a proactive stance on securing extended supply chains. Simultaneously, investments in innovative cyber skill development, such as military esports, demonstrate a growing understanding of the foundational role human expertise plays in future cyber defense.
