# Daily Threat Intelligence Digest - November 22, 2025

Today's threat intelligence landscape offers a stark reminder of the persistent and evolving nature of cyber risks, ranging from high-profile data breaches targeting critical infrastructure to significant legal developments impacting corporate cybersecurity accountability. The overarching message remains clear: proactive security measures are not just advisable, but absolutely fundamental in navigating this complex digital era.

The past 24 hours have brought to light two distinct, yet equally concerning, data breach incidents that underscore the continued vulnerability of both public sector entities and critical services. In Southeast Asia, Thailand's state-owned telecommunications enterprise, National Telecom Public Company Limited (NT), has reportedly suffered a significant data compromise. A threat actor is currently offering an alleged dataset of nearly 1.2 million records for sale on a dark web forum for $300. The stolen data is highly granular, reportedly including sensitive customer personal information such as full names, addresses, mobile numbers, and usernames, alongside service details like tariff plans and internet speeds. Even more alarming are the technical details, including connection locations (latitude/longitude coordinates), device serial numbers, and OLT IP addresses, which could provide attackers with an intricate map of NT's infrastructure and customer base.

Concurrently, the Black Shrantac ransomware group has claimed responsibility for a breach against the Superintendencia Nacional de Fiscalización Laboral (SUNAFIL), Peru's government agency responsible for enforcing labor laws. The group has listed SUNAFIL on their leak site, asserting possession of approximately 200 GB of internal files. Samples provided indicate the compromised data includes highly sensitive information such as labor inspection reports, details of complaints and legal disputes, personal email data, internal administrative spreadsheets with employee contact information, and even scanned identification documents and handwritten entry logs. This incident highlights the dual threat of ransomware: not only the potential for system disruption but also the severe consequences of data exfiltration and public exposure of confidential government and citizen information.

These breaches serve as concrete examples of the "alarming increase in cyberattacks" and the "continuously evolving tools and techniques" of cybercriminals, as highlighted by a recent cybersecurity analysis. The article underscores that sophisticated threats like data breaches, ransomware, and state-sponsored cyber warfare are becoming more frequent and complex, making proactive security a paramount concern for organizations of all sizes.

Adding another layer to the complex cybersecurity narrative, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its high-stakes lawsuit against SolarWinds and its chief information security officer, Timothy G. Brown. The case, initiated in October 2023, had accused the company of fraud and internal control failures, alleging that SolarWinds misled investors about its security practices leading up to the infamous 2020 supply chain attack attributed to the Russian state-sponsored threat actor APT29. While the SEC's decision to dismiss the case was made in a joint motion with SolarWinds, and the agency stated it "does not necessarily reflect the Commission's position on any other case," this development carries significant implications. It suggests the immense legal hurdles involved in prosecuting companies for alleged cybersecurity disclosure deficiencies, even in the wake of a globally impactful breach. This outcome could influence how organizations approach transparency and reporting around cybersecurity risks and incidents, potentially shifting the focus back even more heavily onto robust preventative measures rather than solely relying on post-breach legal recourse.

## Key Insights

*   **Persistent Threat to Critical Infrastructure and Public Sector:** The breaches at Thailand's state-owned National Telecom and Peru's government labor agency, SUNAFIL, underscore the ongoing and successful targeting of critical services and government bodies by threat actors, leading to significant exposure of both citizen and operational data.
*   **Complexities of Cybersecurity Accountability:** The dismissal of the SEC's lawsuit against SolarWinds highlights the significant legal hurdles in prosecuting companies for alleged cybersecurity disclosure failures, even after major supply chain compromises. This development could influence how organizations approach incident reporting and investor communication around cyber risk.
*   **Data Monetization and Ransomware as Key Drivers:** The Black Shrantac ransomware group's actions against SUNAFIL and the dark web sale of NT's data reinforce that financial gain, through extortion or direct data sales, continues to be a primary motivation for cybercriminals, driving a relentless pursuit of vulnerable targets.

Looking ahead, the convergence of increasing threat sophistication, the persistent targeting of critical sectors, and the complexities of legal accountability means organizations must double down on their proactive cybersecurity strategies. This includes not only technical defenses but also robust incident response planning and transparent, yet legally sound, communication protocols. Vigilance and adaptability will be key to navigating the evolving threat landscape.
