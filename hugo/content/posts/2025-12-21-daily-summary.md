**[NEW] RansomHouse RaaS unveils "Mario" encryptor with multi-layered data processing**
The RansomHouse ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group has significantly upgraded its encryptor, making data recovery and analysis substantially more difficult for defenders. Dubbed "Mario" by researchers at Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, the new encryptor replaces the previous single-pass encryption with a more complex two-stage process using both a 32-byte primary and an 8-byte secondary key [RansomHouse upgrades encryption with multi-layered data processing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomhouse-upgrades-encryption-with-multi-layered-data-processing/). This multi-layered approach increases encryption entropy, hindering partial data recovery efforts. The update also introduces a new file processing strategy with dynamic chunk sizing for files over 8GB and intermittent encryption, a technique designed to thwart static analysis by creating non-linear processing patterns [RansomHouse upgrades encryption with multi-layered data processing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomhouse-upgrades-encryption-with-multi-layered-data-processing/). This evolution signals a deliberate shift by RansomHouse from scale to efficiency and evasion, increasing pressure on victims during negotiations and complicating incident response for targeted organizations. The new variant continues to target VM files and renames encrypted data with a `.emario` extension [RansomHouse upgrades encryption with multi-layered data processing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomhouse-upgrades-encryption-with-multi-layered-data-processing/).
